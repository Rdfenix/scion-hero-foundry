This family of Gods claims thatits origins go back over 7,000 years to thebanks of the Nile River in northeastAfrica, and it has endured throughcultural, mythic and physical changesin the World’s very structure.As a pantheon, the Pesedjetconcerns itself with ma’at—justiceexpressed through social order.For the Pesedjet, everyonemust know his or herplace, and each post mustbe fi lled with the right person. In the times before time, theTitans destroyed appropriate relationships between people,and the Pesedjet created a social order in which peoplecould live knowing their place in an established hierarchy.Today, the Pesedjet’s Scions tend to concernthemselves with disruptions in social stability caused bythe Titans’ actions. Movements of refugees, discontentcaused by spiritual poverty and unemployment,revolutionary movements—these come to the Pesedjet’snotice as disturbances in the mythic realms. Other divinetribes view the Pesedjet as hidebound and conservative,but they grant that the Egyptian Gods really know howto impose long-lasting order in a chaotic world.The Pesedjet’s greatest weakness is its commitment tostability at any cost. The Egyptian Gods and their Scionsprefer minimally disruptive solutions to problems, trustingin old patterns to maintain the status quo. Other Gods findthis attitude frustrating. Old patterns allowed the Titans tobreak free in the first place; why perpetuate easily disruptedsystems? Still, the Egyptian deities promote tradition andconservative attitudes as bulwarks against chaos, leavingclose-knit but reactionary societies in their wake.","virtues":[{"name":"Conviction","value":1,"max":5,"min":1},{"name":"Harmony","value":1,"max":5,"min":1},{"name":"Order","value":1,"max":5,"min":1},{"name":"Piety","value":1,"max":5,"min":1}],"deities":[{"name":"ANUBIS","favoredSkills":["animalKen","empathy","integrity","medicine","melee","occult"]},{"name":"ATUM-RE","favoredSkills":["academics","art","fortitude","investigation","politics","presence"]},{"name":"BASTET","favoredSkills":["athletics","awareness","brawl","larceny","stealth","survival"]},{"name":"GEB","favoredSkills":["art","command","empathy","fortitude","politics","science"]},{"name":"HORUS","favoredSkills":["athletics","awareness","brawl","command","melee","politics"]},{"name":"ISIS","favoredSkills":["academics","integrity","investigation","occult","politics","presence"]},{"name":"OSIRIS","favoredSkills":["awareness","command","fortitude","investigation","politics","presence"]},{"name":"PTAH","favoredSkills":["art","craft","investigation","larceny","science","thrown"]},{"name":"SET","favoredSkills":["brawl","command","control","melee","presence","survival"]},{"name":"SOBEK","favoredSkills":["athletics","awareness","brawl","larceny","presence","stealth"]},{"name":"THOTH","favoredSkills":["academics","investigation","integrity","occult","politics","science"]}]},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0}}

Arete—personal excellence inservice to humanity—is the motivating urge of this tribeof Gods and its Scions. It is important for most people toknow their place, but it is equally important for some to riseabove their stations and create new patterns for human life.In modern times, the Dodekatheon’s Scions seek tomanifest and awaken great spirits in society—as artists,warriors, spiritual seekers, judges, leaders and poets.Extraordinary individuals can strengthen the fabric ofreality so that Titans can gain no purchase on it or ripthrough illusion’s curtains. Sometimes, the Scions ofthe Olympians challenge mortals, and sometimes, theyare the mortals challenged by the Gods. Both routeslead to greatness—an exaltation of human endeavor thatblocks the Titans from destroying the World.The Greek pantheon’s greatest weakness is hubris—belief that the individual is capable of winning outagainst Fate. Every God in the Dodekatheon believes thathis most recent favored Scion is capable of surviving thetitanspawn onslaught and changing the World.

Relying on the safetyof numbers, the Aesir absorbedtheir rivals into their ranks and thuspreserved themselves in difficult times.The Aesir represent a third option apart fromthose espoused by the Dodekatheon and thePesedjet.

Yet, theyalso emphasize personal rights and individual honor.Therefore, while family and nation are important,injustice against a single person is cause for actionand even vengeance.Of all the divine tribes, the Aesir are the mostdirectly affected by Fate. Nearly every Norse Godand Goddess is fated to end badly at Ragnarök,the prophesied ending of the nine worlds.

On the other hand, theirentanglements with Fate cause many complicationsfor the Aesir and their Scions alike.The Aesir’s great weaknesses are a preponderanceof enemies, an obsession with Fate and a fondnessfor aggressive solutions (which is how they acquiredso many foes in the fi rst place). Titanspawn are tobe killed fi rst; questions can be asked later usingmagic, if necessary. At the same time, the bindingsof Fate urge these Gods to ask for propheciesfrom nearly everyone, as they seek to avoid theirdoom at Ragnarök.

A specifi c human is unimportant.Likewise, a specific village, family, clan or nation isequally unimportant. The most important issue for thistribe is that the sun continues on its daily course, thatthe moon follows the sun in its appointed rounds andthat the stars continue to shine on their proper schedule.Yet astronomical normality and regularity require bloodysacrifice, and even if the other Gods deplore the AztecGods’ methods, they cannot deny that at least thecalendar proceeds in its usual and expected way.Of all the divine tribes, the Aztlánti are the leastconcerned with the dictates of Fate or the potential doomof the Gods. They are the most mutable of form, the mostmutable of apparent purpose and the least suspiciousof the ambitions of their Scions. Of course, part of thereason for their carefree attitude toward their children istheir attitude toward pain and death. What better bloodto spill to ensure the continuation of the sun’s coursethan the blood of a glorious child of the Gods?The Atzlánti have weaknesses, naturally, and theirgreatest stumbling block is their desperate need forblood. Blood fuels and expedites all Aztec magic anddivine powers, and while Quetzalcoátl might need onlya drop for most of his workings, Huitzilopochtli seemsto need bucketsful.

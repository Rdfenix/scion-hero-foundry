As a pantheon, the Pesedjetconcerns itself with ma’at—justiceexpressed through social order. For the Pesedjet, everyonemust know his or herplace, and each post mustbe fi lled with the right person. In the times before time, theTitans destroyed appropriate relationships between people,and the Pesedjet created a social order in which peoplecould live knowing their place in an established hierarchy.Today, the Pesedjet’s Scions tend to concernthemselves with disruptions in social stability caused bythe Titans’ actions. Movements of refugees, discontentcaused by spiritual poverty and unemployment,revolutionary movements—these come to the Pesedjet’snotice as disturbances in the mythic realms. <br />Other divinetribes view the Pesedjet as hidebound and conservative,but they grant that the Egyptian Gods really know howto impose long-lasting order in a chaotic world.<br />The Pesedjet’s greatest weakness is its commitment tostability at any cost.

Old patterns allowed the Titans tobreak free in the first place; why perpetuate easily disruptedsystems? Still, the Egyptian deities promote tradition andconservative attitudes as bulwarks against chaos, leavingclose-knit but reactionary societies in their wake.","virtues":[{"name":"Conviction","value":1,"max":5,"min":1},{"name":"Harmony","value":1,"max":5,"min":1},{"name":"Order","value":1,"max":5,"min":1},{"name":"Piety","value":1,"max":5,"min":1}],"deities":[{"name":"ANUBIS","favoredSkills":["animalKen","empathy","integrity","medicine","melee","occult"]},{"name":"ATUM-RE","favoredSkills":["academics","art","fortitude","investigation","politics","presence"]},{"name":"BASTET","favoredSkills":["athletics","awareness","brawl","larceny","stealth","survival"]},{"name":"GEB","favoredSkills":["art","command","empathy","fortitude","politics","science"]},{"name":"HORUS","favoredSkills":["athletics","awareness","brawl","command","melee","politics"]},{"name":"ISIS","favoredSkills":["academics","integrity","investigation","occult","politics","presence"]},{"name":"OSIRIS","favoredSkills":["awareness","command","fortitude","investigation","politics","presence"]},{"name":"PTAH","favoredSkills":["art","craft","investigation","larceny","science","thrown"]},{"name":"SET","favoredSkills":["brawl","command","control","melee","presence","survival"]},{"name":"SOBEK","favoredSkills":["athletics","awareness","brawl","larceny","presence","stealth"]},{"name":"THOTH","favoredSkills":["academics","investigation","integrity","occult","politics","science"]}]},"flags":{},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0}}

The Atzlánti work to ensure the continuity of the Overworld in synchronicity with the World. The Dodekatheon, the Aesir and the Pesedjet work to ensure the continuity of human communities.

One prosperous village or town ranks as a greater achievement than saving an island or even the World. In this attention todetail, the Loa mock the greater pantheons. Why bother saving the World if the people die and their towns are inruins? What’s the point if your temples are aesthetically pleasing but spiritually dead?Because the pantheon is still growing, the Gods relyon an active community for worshippers who fill themspiritual energy.

She can remotely manipulate a hand-held object she can see in the water with her full dice pool, although she can take no other physical actions at the same time. She can stiffen the water beneath her feet in order to walk on its surface. She can even have the water push her along from all sides, allowing her to take a full Move action while swimming, rather than half (see p. 180 in Chapter Six). Alternatively, moving through the water thus could increase her Dodge DV by an amount equal to her Legend as long as she does nothing but dodge incoming attacks. The Boon also allows such random tricks as having the Scion instantly dry off by flinging all water off her body or creating a water bridge so an aquatic creature can swim from one container to another.<br /> This Boon works only on liquid water, and a Scion can affect five cubic yards of water at a time per dot of Legend he has. (If she’s walking on water, she can affect one 30’ x 15’ rectangle on the surface per dot of Legend she has. The affected area supports only her and anything she can carry unaided.) Her command is not such, however, that she can use water to restrain or inflict direct physical damage against an opponent with a liquid shape of her creation."

With this Boon, she can take liquid water, steam, ice or fog and change any one into any of the other three. The amount of water she can affect is the same as per Water Control, and the water remains in its new state for a number of actions equal to the successes rolled to activate the Boon. Water under this effect is also subject to the Scion’s Water Control as long as the Scion maintains contact with some portion of it. The Scion can now inflict damage against a single opponent with blasts of steam or with ice projectiles, using her regular traits. (The damage for a steam blast is always lethal environmental damage [Damage: 2L/action, Trauma: 3], but damage can be bashing or lethal for an ice projectile.) The character may also create a club, axe, knife or sword out of ice and use it as a normal weapon of that type. Water in an altered state doesn’t melt, freeze, boil or condense as it normally would in its current environment for the duration of the effect. As altered steam, it maintains a constant temperature of 220 degrees; as altered liquid water or altered fog, it stays at 70 degrees; as altered ice, it stays at 14 degrees. (That’s all Fahrenheit, by the way.) When the effect ends, the water instantly resumes its original state and temperature."

Granted, most of those legends involve some pompous mortal claiming to be the best there is at what she does and an offended God’s reaction to that claim not being very pretty. Nonetheless, the Greek Gods and the society that venerated them held the concept of excellence in such high regard that it became a Purview specific to them. <br /> This Purview doesn’t bestow specific powers, exactly, as much as it magnifies one’s talents to divine proportions. When a Scion takes an Arete, he assigns to it one of his Abilities. (That Ability must be rated at three dots or higher first.) Thereafter, whenever the Scion’s player rolls a dice pool that includes that chosen Ability, the pool receives a number of bonus dice based on the number of dots he has of Arete. Alternatively, the Scion may sacrifice two of those bonus dice (provided he has at least two available) in exchange for a potential reroll in case his first roll fails. If the roll on which he sacrificed two bonus dice doesn’t have the good sense to fail, however, the player doesn’t get to roll those bonus dice after the fact. Nor does he get to reroll a successful roll in hopes of scoring even more successes. <br /> A character may have an Arete in any Ability (or as many Abilities as) he wants, but he must purchase the dots for each Ability’s Arete separately.

The same goes for a fellow Scion who has fewer Legend dots than she does. If that fellow Scion has more dots of Legend, the character cannot experience his perceptions.

This Boon is also good for keeping a source of flame from consuming the breathable air in an enclosed space. <br /> The Scion must be able to see the flame he intends to bolster, but once he uses the Boon, he can leave its presence without canceling the effect. The fire he bolsters with this Boon can be no larger than that of an average campfire (roughly a yard in diameter). <br /> If no source of flame is available, the Scion can create a fire the size of a candle flame from thin air. It burns at the end of his finger or from some point on the Birthright he uses to activate the Boon. The flame isn’t strong enough to cause damage in combat, but it can ignite a flammable substance easily enough."

She can either radiate a glow from her entire body, shining with the intensity of a 100-watt incandescent light bulb, or focus that light to a narrower beam. For instance, she could narrow the focus of the light to come from her palm or her eyes to act as a high-powered flashlight. The Scion can emit soft light thus for one scene. <br /> Alternatively, the character can concentrate her light into a single intense burst that gleams from some reflective surface on her person, be it from the steel edge of her weapon, the metal buttons on her jacket or the surgical-steel head of her tongue stud. (Such a burst imposes a -2 distraction penalty on the victim’s non-reflexive actions until the Scion’s next action, and it ends the Scion’s use of this Boon.) The Scion could even focus the light down to a pinpoint intense enough to scorch an object or ignite a flammable accelerant.(The pinpoint is not intense enough to damage a victim in combat, though.)"

This attitude unnerves and intimidates any opponent who faces him in combat, inflicting a penalty equal to the Scion’s Legend on any attack roll the opponent makes. This penalty applies to any character with a lesser or equal Legend rating who attempts to attack the Scion. This idealized aspect lasts for a number of consecutive actions during the battle equal to the successes the Scion’s player rolled to activate it, and he can invoke it only once during any given battle."

She can breathe water as easily as air, and she is neither scalded by boiling water nor subject to debilitating frostbite from ice. Having boiling water poured on one’s flesh still hurts, mind you, and being bound in ice or cast adrift in frigid water can still numb and paralyze a Scion. Neither of those extremes can cause the Scion actual physical damage, though.<br /> When the Scion moves from air to water or vice versa, she must spend one action Inactive in order to purge one substance from her lungs and breathe in the other. She can forestall this necessity via the normal rules for holding her breath (on p. 182). If the Scion is breathing water, any toxins in that water affect her just as breathing in airborne toxins would on land."

She can remotely manipulate a hand-held object she can see in the water with her full dice pool, although she can take no other physical actions at the same time. She can stiffen the water beneath her feet in order to walk on its surface. She can even have the water push her along from all sides, allowing her to take a full Move action while swimming, rather than half (see p. 180 in Chapter Six). Alternatively, moving through the water thus could increase her Dodge DV by an amount equal to her Legend as long as she does nothing but dodge incoming attacks. The Boon also allows such random tricks as having the Scion instantly dry off by flinging all water off her body or creating a water bridge so an aquatic creature can swim from one container to another.<br /> This Boon works only on liquid water, and a Scion can affect five cubic yards of water at a time per dot of Legend he has. (If she’s walking on water, she can affect one 30’ x 15’ rectangle on the surface per dot of Legend she has. The affected area supports only her and anything she can carry unaided.) Her command is not such, however, that she can use water to restrain or inflict direct physical damage against an opponent with a liquid shape of her creation."

              "description": "Defying the laws of thermodynamics, the Scion can instantly change the state of a body of water just by touching it. With this Boon, she can take liquid water, steam, ice or fog and change any one into any of the other three. The amount of water she can affect is the same as per Water Control, and the water remains in its new state for a number of actions equal to the successes rolled to activate the Boon. Water under this effect is also subject to the Scion’s Water Control as long as the Scion maintains contact with some portion of it. The Scion can now inflict damage against a single opponent with blasts of steam or with ice projectiles, using her regular traits. (The damage for a steam blast is always lethal environmental damage [Damage: 2L/action, Trauma: 3], but damage can be bashing or lethal for an ice projectile.) The character may also create a club, axe, knife or sword out of ice and use it as a normal weapon of that type. Water in an altered state doesn’t melt, freeze, boil or condense as it normally would in its current environment for the duration of the effect. As altered steam, it maintains a constant temperature of 220 degrees; as altered liquid water or altered fog, it stays at 70 degrees; as altered ice, it stays at 14 degrees. (That’s all Fahrenheit, by the way.) When the effect ends, the water instantly resumes its original state and temperature."

It lasts for one day per success garnered by the (Stamina + Fortitude) roll. <br/> The Scion can ward an area against as many different types of threats as she wants, but each threat requires its own activation roll and expenditure. (In effect, she must stack multiple wards on the same area.) Characters with more Legend than the Scion who laid down the ward can attempt to batter their way through the perimeter, thus destroying the ward. The ward can take a number of health levels of damage equal to ([the Scion’s Legend x 5] + [activation roll successes]), and it has a Hardness rating equal to the Scion’s Legend."

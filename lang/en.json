    "PESEDJET": {
      "NAME": "PESEDJET",
      "DESCRIPTION": "The Pesedjet, originating from Egypt, is the oldest (though not necessarily the wisest) of the pantheons. This family of Gods claims their origins date back more than 7,000 years, on the banks of the Nile River in northeast Africa, and has endured through cultural, mythical, and physical changes in the very fabric of the World. As a pantheon, the Pesedjet is concerned with ma’at — justice expressed through social order. For the Pesedjet, everyone must know their place, and every position must be filled by the right person. In the times before time, the Titans destroyed the proper relationships between people, and the Pesedjet created a social order in which people could live knowing their place in an established hierarchy. Today, Scions of the Pesedjet tend to be concerned with disruptions in social stability caused by the Titans' actions. Refugee movements, discontent caused by spiritual poverty and unemployment, revolutionary movements — these draw the attention of the Pesedjet as disturbances in the mythical realms. <br />Other divine tribes view the Pesedjet as backward and conservative but admit that the Egyptian Gods truly know how to impose lasting order on a chaotic world.<br />The Pesedjet's greatest weakness is its commitment to stability at any cost. The Egyptian Gods and their Scions prefer minimally disruptive solutions to problems, relying on old patterns to maintain the status quo. <br />Other Gods find this attitude frustrating. Old patterns allowed the Titans to break free in the first place; why perpetuate easily disrupted systems? Still, the Egyptian deities promote tradition and conservative attitudes as bulwarks against chaos, leaving united but reactionary societies in their wake."
    },
    "DODEKATHEON": {
      "NAME": "DODEKATHEON",
      "DESCRIPTION": "The second oldest of the divine tribes, the Dodekatheon comprises the Gods of Olympus from Greco-Roman legends. Their origins are obscure, as the ancient Greeks already knew their Gods when they migrated to the Mediterranean Sea about 4,000 years ago, but they were still changing and growing 2,500 years ago, and their forms only became fixed about 1,500 years ago. <br />Where the Pesedjet emphasizes social and cultural stability over and against individual rights, the Dodekatheon sought to impose patterns of individuality within the community on humanity. Arete — personal excellence in service to humanity — is the motivating drive of this tribe of Gods and their Scions. It is important for most people to know their place, but it is equally important for some to rise above their stations and create new standards for human life. In modern times, Scions of the Dodekatheon seek to manifest and awaken great spirits in society — such as artists, warriors, spiritual seekers, judges, leaders, and poets. Extraordinary individuals can strengthen the fabric of reality so that the Titans do not gain purchase on it or tear through the curtains of illusion. <br />Sometimes, the Scions of the Olympians challenge mortals, and sometimes, they are the mortals challenged by the Gods. Both routes lead to greatness — an exaltation of human effort that stops the Titans from destroying the World. The greatest weakness of the Greek pantheon is hubris — the belief that the individual is capable of overcoming Fate. Every God in the Dodekatheon believes that their most recent favorite Scion is capable of surviving the onslaught of titanspawn and changing the World. Investing time and training in Scion after Scion, the whole pantheon places tremendous trust in its heroes, although it acknowledges that many have fallen only into ruin and darkness. The next Scion, of course, will prove a worthy vessel for the Gods' trust and favor…"
    },
    "AESIR": {
      "NAME": "AESIR",
      "DESCRIPTION": "Born in the wilds and ruins of Northern Europe, among Germanic warriors and Norse pirates, the Aesir make up the fourth oldest of the divine families. Their pantheon is the product of a forced union about 1,000 years ago, when the Aesir and the Vanir (an earlier pantheon) were both devastated by the Titans during a war in the North. <br />Relying on safety in numbers, the Aesir absorbed their rivals into their ranks and thus preserved themselves in difficult times. The Aesir represent a third option, distinct from those championed by the Dodekatheon and the Pesedjet. Aesir Scions promote community stability as a shield against the harshness of modern life. However, they also emphasize personal rights and individual honor. Therefore, while family and nation are important, injustice against a single person is grounds for action and even revenge. <br />Of all the divine tribes, the Aesir are most directly affected by Fate. Almost every Norse God and Goddess is destined to meet a tragic end at Ragnarök, the prophesied end of the nine worlds. Both individually and as a group, the Aesir motivate their Scions to find ways around this terrible fate. They challenge both specific persons and entire communities, fighting for greater justice and firmer commitments to order. <br />On the other hand, their entanglements with Fate cause many complications for the Aesir and their Scions. The Aesir's great weaknesses are a preponderance of enemies, an obsession with Fate, and a predilection for aggressive solutions (which is how they acquired so many enemies in the first place). Titanspawn must be killed first; questions can be asked later using magic, if necessary. At the same time, the bonds of Fate instigate these Gods to ask for prophecies from almost everyone, as they seek to avoid their ruin at Ragnarök. Invariably, their enemies grant them foreknowledge of their doom, with oracles that further restrict their possible courses of action."
    },
    "ATZLANTI": {
      "NAME": "ATZLÁNTI",
      "DESCRIPTION": "Emerging sometime between 3,000 and 4,000 years ago, the Aztec Gods have no name for their pantheon. Other divine tribes usually call them Atzlánti. Capricious and cruel in a way that other pantheons are not, the Aztec Gods are bloodthirsty, aggressive, and violent. They sire Scions most often with mortals descended from Nahuatl-speaking tribes, wherever such native peoples exist. <br />For the Atzlánti, continuity is more important than community or individuality. A specific human is unimportant. Likewise, a specific village, family, clan, or nation is equally unimportant. The most important issue for this tribe is that the sun continues on its daily course, that the moon follows the sun on its appointed rounds, and that the stars continue to shine on their proper schedule. <br />However, normality and astronomical regularity demand bloody sacrifice, and even if other Gods deplore the Aztec Gods' methods, they cannot deny that, at least, the calendar proceeds in its usual and expected manner. Of all the divine tribes, the Atzlánti are the least concerned with the dictates of Fate or the potential ruin of the Gods. They are the most mutable in form, the most mutable in apparent purpose, and the least suspicious of their Scions' ambitions. <br />Of course, part of the reason for their carefree attitude toward their children is their attitude toward pain and death. What better blood to spill to ensure the continuation of the sun's course than the blood of a glorious child of the Gods? The Atzlánti have weaknesses, naturally, and their greatest obstacle is their desperate need for blood. <br />Blood fuels and facilitates all Aztec magic and divine powers, and while Quetzalcoátl might need only a drop for most of his works, Huitzilopochtli seems to need bucketfuls. Other Gods wonder how much of this type of sacrifice is personal preference and how much is genuine necessity. Nevertheless, the Atzlánti need blood, recently spilled animal or human blood, to play their part in preserving reality. Their Scions are similarly affected."
    },
    "AMATSUKAMI": {
      "NAME": "AMATSUKAMI",
      "DESCRIPTION": "The Amatsukami are the celestial deities of ancient Japan. When asked how long they have existed, they will certainly answer “forever”. Other tribes usually estimate their age somewhere between that of the Dodekatheon and the Aesir, although it is possible the Amatsukami aren't lying about their age. <br />Regardless, the Amatsukami certainly have a different way of working in the World. The Atzlánti work to ensure the continuity of the Overworld in sync with the World. The Dodekatheon, the Aesir, and the Pesedjet work to ensure the continuity of human communities. The Amatsukami, however, emphasize the continuity of Nature — the reality of the World and all its natural wonders, the interactions between the living and the non-living to create beauty, and the changing beauty formed by states of permanent change. For the Amatsukami, to light a candle is to cast a shadow, and to kill a butterfly is to cause a drought. No action is truly separate from any other; all choices occur within a continuous framework of the Now. <br />Therefore, this pantheon works for the right and proper balance of all being: human individuality in cooperation with the community, in cooperation with nature, in cooperation with divinity. Their Scions work to establish “ecological” solutions to complex problems, believing that only multi-layered and beautiful answers will keep the Titans at bay. The downside of such elegant and serene natural resolutions is that they take time to implement, and there is a certain amount of hesitation about what exactly to do. The Amatsukami tend not to take the most direct route to whatever their solution is, in order to buy more time to perfect that effort. In situations where time is of the essence, the Scions of the Japanese Gods often run out of it."
    },
    "LOA": {
      "NAME": "LOA",
      "DESCRIPTION": "The Loa are deities from ancient West Africa, transplanted through slavery to the Caribbean and North and South America. They make up the most mixed of the pantheons in terms of age. Gods only a few hundred years old dwell alongside Gods who walked the earth millennia ago. <br />Other Gods might mock the Loa as mere spirits raised above their station and rank, but their actual power and authority certainly match those of their detractors. Much of the mockery against them, therefore, is social rather than metaphysical. Of all the pantheons, the Loa remember their origins as Scions. They tend to treat their progeny with respect and honor. <br />In fact, the Voodoo deities seem to believe that their pantheon has not finished growing yet, and every God has a range of spirits, lesser deities, and borrowed Catholic saints to summon as messengers, allies, and companions for their Scions. <br />The Loa form an interesting complement to the Amatsukami. Where the Japanese pantheon works for the benefit of the totality of nature in all its diversity, the Loa focus their energy on retaining the energy and sanctity of local places. <br />The whole of nature is nowhere near as important as the integrity of the here-and-now for the Loa. Voodoo deities are ardent believers in the idea that small is beautiful. A house where the inhabitants live in peace, prosperity, and happiness is a good and beautiful goal for the Loa. A prosperous village or city counts as a greater achievement than saving an island or even the World. In this attention to detail, the Loa mock larger pantheons. Why bother saving the World if people die and their cities lie in ruins? What is the point if your temples are aesthetically pleasing but spiritually dead? Because the pantheon is still growing, the Gods depend on an active community of worshippers who fill them with spiritual energy. As a result, Voodoo deities suffer from a certain degree of myopia. In the pursuit of unity, prosperity, and peace at the local level, they sometimes lose sight of larger issues, such as defeating the Titans."

  "KNACKS": {
    "EPIC_STRENGTH": {
      "NAME": "EPIC STRENGTH",
      "POWERS": {
        "CRUSHING_GRIP": {
          "NAME": "Crushing Grip",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion is a fearsome wrestler and grappler, not to be trifled with. When he is locked in a clinch and has assumed control of it, the character may not only inflict the normal amount of damage (see p. 202), but this damage is now lethal as well. A character can still choose to hold an opponent without inflicting damage, or he may choose to break the hold. He can even soften his touch and inflict bashing damage. The damage the character can inflict when his temper flares, however, is tremendous and often quite bloody."
        },
        "HOLY_BOUND": {
          "NAME": "Holy Bound",
          "DESCRIPTION": "Only characters whose Boons include the Sky Purview have more freedom to defy the laws of physics. Simply having Epic Strength allows a Scion to perform prodigious leaps that leave mortals slack-jawed. For instance, if a Scion has Strength 5, Athletics 3, and Epic Strength 3, he can jump 12 yards (approx. 11m) straight up or 24 yards (approx. 22m) forward. (See “Movement” on p. 180.) This Knack, however, doubles a Scion's vertical and horizontal jump distances. With it, the aforementioned character could jump an incredible 24 yards straight up (from the ground to a seventh-story balcony, for example) or 48 yards forward in a single leap."
        },
        "HOLY_RAMPAGE": {
          "NAME": "Holy Rampage",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion is especially good at breaking inanimate objects. When he spends a point of Legend and applies all his strength to break something — whether punching, kicking, or throwing his shoulder against it — the Hardness of the item is halved against the attack. This bonus applies only when the character attempts to break an inanimate object that is loose or under his control. If someone else has control of the object in question, the Scion must take it from them first."
        },
        "HURL_TO_THE_HORIZON": {
          "NAME": "Hurl to the Horizon",
          "DESCRIPTION": "Baseballs, manhole covers, beer kegs, and other thrown objects become tiny dots in the distance when the Scion throws them. Having this Knack doubles the distance he can throw something as a feat of strength. It also doubles the Range of a normal thrown item after calculating the standard increase in Range granted by having Epic Strength. This Knack does not make the character more capable of seeing or hitting a target, however. Nor does it confer extra damage to an attack made with a thrown weapon."
        },
        "UPLIFTING_MIGHT": {
          "NAME": "Uplifting Might",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion can lift and hold tremendous loads that would make even other Scions with Epic Strength stagger. After checking the character's lifting capacity on the “Feats of Strength” table and adjusting that capacity based on the character's Epic Strength, this Knack (and the expenditure of a point of Legend) doubles that lifting capacity. This Knack does not affect a character's ability to break or throw an object."
        }
      }
    },
    "EPIC_DEXTERITY": {
      "NAME": "EPIC DEXTERITY",
      "POWERS": {
        "CATS_GRACE": {
          "NAME": "Cat’s Grace",
          "DESCRIPTION": "This Knack imbues a Scion with the uncanny ability to remain upright despite treacherous terrain or an enemy's best attempts to knock him down. For example, a character with this Knack never suffers knockdown (see p. 198) from an attack. The player doesn't even need to roll. The character still takes the damage, but remains on his feet. Additionally, a character with this Knack ignores all difficulty penalties based on unstable footing and treacherous terrain. He still suffers speed penalties for moving through ankle-to-knee-deep water or mud, but his dice pools for actions taken in such terrain suffer no penalties."
        },
        "LIGHTNING_SPRINTER": {
          "NAME": "Lightning Sprinter",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion is lightning on two legs, whizzing past as a blur, leaving behind leaves, sand, or loose ground debris he has already covered. This Knack doubles the amount of distance he can cover in a Dash action, after calculating the new Dash distance based on his Epic Dexterity. Furthermore, it negates the movement penalties a character would accumulate for dashing through water or mud that is between ankle and shoulder height, provided that: A) the character started his Dash action on terrain without such penalty, and B) the character continues to perform consecutive Dash actions. As long as he keeps running, his feet skim across the surface of the water or mud like a skipping stone. If he slows down or stops, however, he sinks into the sucking terrain to suffer normal penalties. Activating this Knack costs one Legend point."
        },
        "MONKEY_CLIMBER": {
          "NAME": "Monkey Climber",
          "DESCRIPTION": "Provided he has sufficient hand and footholds, the Scion climbs vertical surfaces with cavalier ease. Where a normal climber might cover only half the distance they would cover in a normal Move action on a successful climb check (see p. 180), a Scion with this Knack suffers no such restriction. Furthermore, provided the Scion has at least one hand (or both feet) on the surface he is climbing, he can perform a second action at the same time (per multiple action rules on p. 179) while still moving along the climbing surface. The Scion cannot “Dash” while climbing, but the bonus to his movement granted by his Epic Dexterity still applies."
        },
        "TRICK_SHOOTER": {
          "NAME": "Trick Shooter",
          "DESCRIPTION": "Not only do the Scion's Epic Dexterity bonus successes add to (Dexterity + Marksmanship) dice rolls, he now doubles the bonus he receives when performing an Aim action (see p. 190). Additionally, the player ignores the difficulty penalty for the character to disarm an opponent with a special ranged attack or to mark his opponent without dealing damage. (See “Special Attacks” on p. 199.) A character must perform an Aim action to be able to ignore such penalties, however. If a character fires from the hip or fires wildly in a gunfight filled with the smell of cordite and a shower of casings, only the regular bonus successes from his Epic Dexterity apply."
        },
        "UNTUCHABLE_OPPONENT": {
          "NAME": "Untouchable Opponent",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion might as well be a ghost for the difficulty his enemies have in laying a hand or weapon on him. The Scion doubles the benefit his Epic Dexterity points add to his Dodge DV. He also ignores a number of DV penalties due to unstable terrain equal to his Epic Dexterity points. Only the normal Epic Dexterity bonus applies to the character's Parry DV, however, and this Knack's bonus to Dodge DV does not apply if the character is merely hiding behind cover. Only if the character is physically dodging the attacks coming his way does this Knack help him. <br /> Activating this Knack costs one Legend point. Its effects last for one scene."

      "POWERS": {
        "DAMAGE_CONVERSION": {
          "NAME": "Damage Conversion",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion can spend a single Legend point to convert all lethal damage from a single attack into bashing damage, though an overload of bashing damage will still wrap existing bashing damage into lethal (see p. 197). This Knack cannot convert aggravated damage into anything less severe. The character cannot convert old lethal damage into bashing damage. The Knack works only on damage received from a single attack."
        },
        "HOLY_FORTITUDE": {
          "NAME": "Holy Fortitude",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The character is the epitome of the sacred ascetic. The periods for which he is able to go without food, water, and sleep double. The amount of time he is able to work at a strenuous task without stopping also doubles."
        },
        "INNER_FURNACE": {
          "NAME": "Inner Furnace",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The character rarely lacks sustenance. Provided he can find some kind of organic substance (from rotten quail eggs to a piece of notebook paper where someone blew their nose), the Scion can eat and survive. And provided he finds a water source (no matter how stagnant or polluted it might be), he can drink and survive. Any pestilence or poison hidden in what he consumes burns up in the fires of his superior constitution, without even requiring a Fortitude check. The same goes for drugs or poisons he ingests on purpose, or for any \"roofie\" a malefactor might try to slip him. He is still just as susceptible to airborne toxins and any drug injected into his bloodstream, but any drug that has to pass through the stomach first stops there. <br /> This Knack does nothing to suppress the gag reflex or make an unappetizing meal taste any better."
        },
        "SELF_HEALING": {
          "NAME": "Self–Healing",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion's player spends a Legend point to repair a single level of damage. This damage can be bashing or lethal, and the healing occurs in an instant without leaving a scar. (Aggravated damage is beyond the power of this Knack to heal.) Scions interested in building their reputation and spreading their legends quickly discover that this Knack is one of the most effective tools for doing so, as bruises, lacerations, and bullet holes disappear before the eyes of astonished onlookers."
        },
        "SOLIPSISTIC_WELL_BEING": {
          "NAME": "Solipsistic Well–Being",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The philosophy of solipsism holds that only the self exists. Consequently, if a solipsist is not aware of something, that something does not exist. With this Knack, a Scion applies this strange philosophy to damage that surprises him. For a single attack that the Scion does not see, hear, or otherwise perceive coming, the Scion can spend a Legend point and a Willpower point to ignore it completely as if it never happened (thus suffering no damage from it). Of course, the attack actually happens — any ammo used is spent, bystanders might be covered in the Scion's blood, the would-be assassin might be standing there holding a dripping knife — but such concerns are immaterial to the Scion victim. <br /> The Scion can use this Knack only once per scene."

        "BENEFIT_OF_THE_DOUBT": {
          "NAME": "Benefit of the Doubt",
          "DESCRIPTION": "Sometimes, for a Scion to help people — or convince them to stay out of danger — those people have to accept ideas that would seem patently ridiculous if they weren't true. A Scion's player with this Knack spends a Legend point, and something in the Scion's posture or expression convinces a single listener not to dismiss what he is saying. Maybe it's the fact that the Scion is taking his words so seriously, or maybe he just has an honest face. Maybe he came highly recommended by a respected colleague. Whatever the reason, the listener gives the Scion the benefit of the doubt regarding what the Scion attempts to explain next, despite what he might be inclined to believe."
        },
        "BLESSING_OF_IMPORTANCE": {
          "NAME": "Blessing of Importance",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion is especially good at winning people over by making them feel special and wanted. By spending a Legend point and championing a person, calling them out in a crowd, or just giving them a secret smile, the Scion recharges that person's spent Willpower points for the scene. The Scion doesn't necessarily have to believe the person is important or special. This Knack works great on mortals but is less effective on Scions, who are usually aware of their charismatic peers' methods. For Scion recipients, the Knack recharges only one Willpower point per dot of Epic Charisma the Scion with this Knack possesses. A character can receive this Willpower boost only once per scene from the same Scion."

          "DESCRIPTION": "With the sheer raw charm this Knack represents, the Scion can smother an outbreak of panic, suspicion, or outright hatred directed at him for one scene. The player need only spend a Legend point. A scene is usually long enough to convince a person that it would be in their best interest to help the character, but it falls to the Scion (and the player's roleplaying) to actually say the right words. During the scene in which this Knack is in effect, the suppressed emotion does not disappear. It just lingers beneath the surface. If the Scion fails to soothe the person's mind by the end of the scene, the suppressed emotion returns with full force the next time the Scion leaves the affected person's presence."
        },
        "INSPIRATIONAL_FIGURE": {
          "NAME": "Inspirational Figure",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion's well-chosen words can tap into humanity's social mindset, giving hope and courage not just to one listener, but to a group. The Scion makes a speech to the assembled listeners — whether asking for help, lifting spirits after a local disaster, or strengthening community bonds among them — and spends a single Legend point. As long as his words are intended to inspire them in some way, every person who can hear him listens spellbound and receives a Willpower point at the end of the speech. The only limit is that the listeners must be able to hear him clearly without the aid of any amplification or broadcasting equipment. <br /> This Knack inspires other Scions as easily as mortals, but does not inspire titanspawn. However, titanspawn are compelled to at least let him finish his speech before carrying out whatever they are plotting."
        },
        "NEVER_SAY_DIE": {
          "NAME": "Never Say Die",
          "DESCRIPTION": "Not every Scion manages to knock down enemies like bowling pins and scatter titanspawn body parts in his wake. Yet, some are so full of optimism and joie de vivre, even when getting beaten due to some spectacular failure, that you just can't help but love them. A Scion might be accident-prone or have an annoying knack for picking fights with titanspawn out of his league, but he takes his lumps with a grin and inspires his companions with his positive attitude. All he has to do is give a thumbs-up, shout an “I'm okay!” or flash a smile full of dangling teeth. When he does this, all Scions in his Band who can see him gain one Willpower point per health level the character has suffered (that is, however many are marked on his character sheet at that moment). The character can inspire his companions this way only once per scene, but he can do so even if knocked down to Incapacitated or killed — after which, he collapses."

        "BLURT_IT_OUT": {
          "NAME": "Blurt It Out",
          "DESCRIPTION": "This Knack represents a gift for making people speak their minds. Scions who possess it typically corner a person who has information they want, start a conversation, steer that conversation toward the information in question, and then pull it out when it's on the tip of the tongue. Others confront victims surrounded by family, friends, or coworkers, in order to make those victims admit damning information when it will cause the most damage. The Scion's player must spend a Legend point to activate the Knack, and the information must have legitimately come up in the conversation. The Scion cannot simply shout “J’accuse!” and use Blurt It Out to force a random confession from a guilty person. (The declamatory French comes only after the Scion uses Blurt It Out effectively.) <br /> Regardless, a victim still has a small chance to catch themselves before bringing about disaster. The victim's player rolls (Willpower + Integrity + Legend) against a difficulty equal to (Scion's Epic Manipulation + 1). If this roll is successful, the player can then spend a Willpower point to avoid the slip."
        },
        "GODS_HONEST": {
          "NAME": "Gods’ Honest",
          "DESCRIPTION": "When trying to convince someone of something, the Scion places his hand on his heart, places his hand on a stack of Bibles, raises his right hand with pinky and thumb crossed in the palm, or performs some other gesture of sincerity. (His player also spends a Legend point.) When he does this, his target accepts that the Scion is telling the truth about the matter at hand, no questions asked, for the rest of the story. Only solid, incontrovertible proof showing that what the Scion said was undeniably false will convince the target that he was deceived. Even then, whoever is showing him the proof will have to convince him that the proof is genuine and not some clever forgery. <br /> A Scion with this Knack need not lie when using it. He can also use it to convince a recalcitrant skeptic of the actual truth. If the Scion does so, no mortal force can convince that person that the Scion was lying (not even professionally forged \"proof\" to the contrary)."
        },
        "OVERT_ORDER": {
          "NAME": "Overt Order",
          "DESCRIPTION": "Sometimes, the direct method is more effective than the cleverest of intricate schemes. With this Knack, a Scion barks a command that the target must obey. Doing so costs one Willpower point, and the command must be one that the Scion can give and the victim can perform in a single action. “Freeze!” is acceptable, as is “Don't shoot!” or “Shoot him!”. Ordering someone to go home and shoot his wife won't work because doing so would take longer than a single action. <br /> A victim of this Knack can interpret the command freely to make it not directly suicidal, but not if all they are trying to do is avoid trouble. For instance, if a victim draws a gun and the Scion commands them to shoot themselves, the victim might shoot themselves in the hand or foot instead of blowing their own brains out. The same goes if a Scion uses this Knack in a seedy pool hall to command a drug dealer to pick a fight with a burly ex-con at the next table. The dealer might reasonably believe the ex-con could kill him, but he still cannot shirk the command. He doesn't have to walk over there and punch the guy, but he still has to do something, like shout a racial slur or throw a beer bottle at the guy's girlfriend. The dealer might flee immediately, but he still has to pick the fight first."
        },
        "STENCH_OF_GUILT": {
          "NAME": "Stench of Guilt",
          "DESCRIPTION": "This Knack gives a Scion insight into the workings of a victim's mind. If the Scion hears a topic come up while the victim is speaking that reminds the victim of a misdeed they are keeping secret, the Scion senses the presence of that secret. The victim need not feel guilty about the wrongs they have committed, but provided they have striven, or are striving, to hide them, the Scion notices. This Knack cannot reveal what secret the victim is hiding, nor does it specifically point out what was said in the conversation that reminded them of the transgression. The context of the conversation is usually enough for an astute Scion to figure out where to start looking, however."
        },
        "TAKES_ONE_TO_KNOW_ONE": {
          "NAME": "Takes One to Know One",
          "DESCRIPTION": "Liars and cheaters recognize their own. If any con artist tries to pull a scam, Scions with this Knack know exactly what kind of person they are dealing with. Whenever the Scion hears a person knowingly tell a lie, the Scion becomes automatically aware of the deception. This Knack does not reveal what the actual truth is. Nor does it work on text written by someone who knows it is false or when someone speaks false words in a language the Scion does not understand."

          "NAME": "Center of Attention",
          "DESCRIPTION": "Whether he is Hugh Jackman on the set of The View or the Phantom of the Opera going unmasked to the masquerade ball, the Scion commands the attention of everyone in the room. This Knack is best used when making a grand entrance, but can also serve as a wonderful broad-spectrum distraction. The character enters a room, the player spends a Legend point, and every eye in the room (as well as the eyes of people watching remotely via live security camera feed) turns to the character. For each Legend point spent, the character can hold everyone's attention for a number of minutes equal to his Epic Appearance dots. Bystanders can continue with what they are doing and carry on conversations with each other, but their attention remains fixed on the Scion. <br /> Titanspawn and Scions can resist this Knack. They can spend a Willpower point to direct their attention elsewhere. If the Scion with Epic Appearance spends another Legend point to continue the effect for subsequent sets of minutes, the resisting party must spend corresponding amounts of Willpower to avoid becoming distracted."
        },
        "COME_HITHER": {
          "NAME": "Come Hither",
          "DESCRIPTION": "Some Scions are so beautiful that you can't help but be drawn to them, and a Scion with this Knack makes that attraction irresistible and inescapable. Whether waving from across a crowded room, emailing a picture of herself with an invitation, or texting a picture message from her phone with the caption “CMERE”, the object of her desire hurries to reach her. The Scion's player spends a Legend point and must single out one recipient at a time. The intended target must be able to see an image of the Scion, must understand that the message is meant for him, and must have a reasonable idea of how to find her. <br /> Scions whose Epic Appearance represents divine ugliness cannot use this Knack. Furthermore, it does not work on beautiful Scions with more Epic Appearance dots than the one using the Knack."
        },
        "DREADFUL_MIEN": {
          "NAME": "Dreadful Mien",
          "DESCRIPTION": "Some Scions are so hideous that seeing them stimulates the primitive centers of the human brain to reckless flight. Most humans manage to suppress this instinctive response and remain in the presence of such Scions, but this Knack overrides that social nicety. When the Scion's player spends a Legend point, the character directs his unholy monstrosity at a single hapless victim in his presence. Overwhelmed, the victim runs for his life and hides somewhere until the next sunrise. People affected by this Knack flee with self-preservation in mind, however, so they won't run blindly into traffic or try to swim across a shark tank to safety.<br /> Scions whose Epic Appearance represents divine beauty cannot use this Knack. Furthermore, it does not work on hideous Scions with more Epic Appearance dots than the one using the Knack."
        },
        "LASTING_IMPRESSION": {
          "NAME": "Lasting Impression",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion has an effect on a subject that lingers. Thoughts of the Scion invade the victim's mind uninvited, either to undermine their concentration or to lift their spirits. A beautiful Scion can use her Epic Appearance to make a character feel good about themselves, granting them an extra Willpower point (which can exceed the character's maximum) and an extra die on any Art, Athletics, Command, Craft, or Integrity dice pools. A hideous Scion inflicts exactly the opposite effect. The fear she instills robs her victim of a Willpower point that they cannot recover until the effect passes. The Scion also disturbs them so deeply that they lose a die from all Academics, Awareness, Control, Politics, or Presence dice pools. <br /> Using this Knack costs the Scion a single Legend point, and its effects last for 24 hours. The Scion can use the Knack on only one person at a time, and the target must be able to see her in person."
        },
        "SERPENT_GAZE": {
          "NAME": "Serpent’s Gaze",
          "DESCRIPTION": "When the Scion spends a Legend point, the person he is trying to affect locks gazes with him and is unable to look away. For combat purposes, the victim becomes Inactive until the Scion breaks eye contact. The Scion can still act, but must perform a second action to do so, maintaining eye contact as a non-rolled action. (As a result, he suffers a -2 penalty to any other action he performs.) This Knack works equally well whether the Scion's Epic Appearance involves beauty or its opposite. <br /> Characters of lower Legend are unable to break the Scion's gaze on their own, but those with equal or higher Legend are not so vulnerable. After the Scion using the Knack performs a full action, the victim of equal or higher Legend can spend a Willpower point to negate the effect. Upon doing so, he remains immune to the effect from the same Scion for the rest of the scene."

        "PERFECT_PITCH": {
          "NAME": "Perfect Pitch",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion can be a musician's best friend or worst nightmare, as she has the innate ability to detect even the subtlest variation in musical pitch. Her sense is so refined that she could pick out a single stray note in an otherwise flawless performance of a Rachmaninoff concert. The one mistake in the middle of the performance rings as clearly in her ears as if someone's cell phone had gone off during the performance playing the SpongeBob theme song. The Scion's sense of hearing is also refined enough to be able to identify with absolute certainty a phone number or security code just by listening to the distinctive key tones."
        },
        "PREDATORY_FOCUS": {
          "NAME": "Predatory Focus",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion is a hunter par excellence. With a successful (Perception + Survival) roll, he can track his prey by scent alone or by nearly invisible physical signs. With this Knack, the hunter can follow his prey across any type of terrain, provided the prey continues to flee and takes no significant steps to mask its scent or minimize the disturbance its passage causes. (The former involves extremes like swimming a mile upstream in a rushing river or taking refuge inside a working pig processing plant. The latter includes little short of levitating or flying.) Picking up a lost trail with this Knack requires a new (Perception + Survival) roll. If the prey has Epic Wits or an Arete in Stealth (see pp. 149-150), the hunter's roll is contested against the prey's (Wits + Stealth)."
        },
        "REFINED_PALATE": {
          "NAME": "Refined Palate",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion has exceptionally precise senses of taste and smell (since the latter enhances the former). With a faint whiff or a tentative taste, the Scion can figure out what ingredients make up a certain mixture and in what proportions. He can also sniff out drugs or poisons that have been added to what he was about to devour, as well as detect airborne toxins by the way they make the air taste. This Knack does not tell a Scion what an ingredient is if he is not already familiar with it. (He would realize that what is making his iced tea sweet is not sugar, for instance, but he wouldn't know it's artificial sweetener if he had never tasted it before.) Instead, the Knack registers each component separately and provides an indication if such components would be dangerous to consume. The Scion also remembers the taste and smell of various ingredients he tries so he can recognize and identify them if exposed to them again."
        },
        "SUBLIMINAL_WARNING": {
          "NAME": "Subliminal Warning",
          "DESCRIPTION": "Whenever the Scion enters an area where an ambush is waiting, even if he has no reason to suspect he is in danger, certain small clues put his subconscious on alert, preparing him for an attack. When the attacker finally launches the surprise attack, the Scion hears the slightest rustle of fabric, sees the slightest twitch in his peripheral vision, or feels the softest movement of displaced air, and the clues he has already noticed add up. As a result, the Scion gains an extra number of dice equal to his Epic Perception on the standard (Wits + Awareness) roll to detect the ambush."
        },
        "UNFAILING_RECOGNITION": {
          "NAME": "Unfailing Recognition",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion can automatically recognize any people to whom she is Fatebound. She can pick out their faces in a crowd with just a glance. She can recognize their voices despite electronic distortion or overwhelming background noise. She knows their scents and their body language and even the exact feel of the way they shake hands. She can also recognize an impostor when someone tries to imitate the voice or appearance of someone she is Fatebound to. <br /> Recognizing others isn't as easy. If, when a Scion meets a character she is not Fatebound to, she makes a concerted effort to try to remember that character's appearance and mannerisms, the player can spend a Willpower point to lock that image in the Scion's mind. Thereafter, she retains the ability to recognize him despite all obfuscation for the rest of the story, as if the two were Fatebound. Afterward, the Scion loses any supernatural ability she had to recognize that character. (She doesn't forget the character's appearance, mind you. It's just that the Knack no longer applies to that person.) <br /> The moment the Scion recognizes a person depends entirely on the Storyteller, as dictated by the needs of the story. If the private investigator stalking the Scion tries to approach the character in disguise at a crowded charity event, the Scion might spot the detective coming from a mile away (even despite the fake beard, padding, spray tan, and sex change). If a Scion of Loki who is a rival to a player's Scion of Anubis arrives in disguise to deliver a cryptic warning, the Scion of Anubis might not recognize her old enemy until the trickster disappears with a wink behind the closing elevator doors. <br /> Finally, as a side effect of this Knack, a Scion can always recognize when someone who isn't disguised is biologically related to a person she knows well (regardless of whether that person is Fatebound to her). She cannot intuitively grasp what that relationship is, but she knows it exists — even if the person in question does not."

        "FAST_LEARNER": {
          "NAME": "Fast Learner",
          "DESCRIPTION": "By applying himself and studying certain subjects intensely, the Scion internalizes them in a fraction of the time it would take a lesser intellect. When doing so, he halves the experience point cost to buy dots in Academics, Medicine, Occult, Politics, or Science, rounding down."
        },
        "KNOW_IT_ALL": {
          "NAME": "Know–It–All",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion is widely read and has a ridiculously thorough education. She may not be a master of any single subject, but she knows a little bit about a wide range of disparate and esoteric subjects. (She could explain the intricacies of the Teapot Dome Scandal in terms of the interpersonal dynamics of the Justice League, then explain why typing certain commands into a UNIX system is a bad idea, before finishing with an explanation of how a Venus flytrap works.) Usually, the burden of roleplaying this Knack falls on the player, so it behooves him to keep an eye out for obscure trivia he can insert into his character's dialogue during play. The Storyteller shares some of this burden as well. During a scene where the characters seem to be stumped or out of options, the Storyteller should “remind” the player of some pertinent piece of obscure trivia his character knows that has direct and helpful relevance to the problem at hand. It behooves the Storyteller, then, to make a list of some of these helpful hints when designing his story. Just in case."
        },
        "MATH_GENIUS": {
          "NAME": "Math Genius",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion is a walking, talking calculator. She can split a restaurant bill for 10 people so everyone pays only what they owe or calculate the standard deviation of oil prices over the last 15 years, all while carrying on an intense conversation about whether Republicans or Democrats tip worse. Provided she knows all the numbers involved, she can crunch the numbers in her head with only a moment's pause. She can also use mathematical shorthand and quick calculus to estimate things like how many jellybeans are in a glass jar at the State Fair or how many Civil War reenactors possessed by titanspawn are charging toward her across the picnic grounds."
        },
        "PERFECT_MEMORY": {
          "NAME": "Perfect Memory",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The character remembers everything about his past, from before the game started to the current moment in the story. If the player forgets an important point or key piece of information from previous sessions, he need only ask the Storyteller and the Storyteller will remind him. It's a good idea for the character's player to take copious notes on the events of each session and verify them with the Storyteller, if only to relieve some of the stress on the Storyteller."
        },
        "TEACHING_PRODIGY": {
          "NAME": "Teaching Prodigy",
          "DESCRIPTION": "With this Knack, a Scion can help another person become a fast learner (per the eponymous Knack). When she makes significant efforts to teach a student in a subject — a distinction better left to the Storyteller — the experience point cost to buy dots in the Ability the teacher teaches is cut in half, rounded down. <br /> The catch built into this Knack is that a Scion cannot teach a student an Ability that she (the teacher) does not possess. Nor can the teacher help a student surpass her in mastery of a subject — which is to say that the Scion cannot teach her student more dots in an Ability than she (the teacher) possesses."

          "NAME": "Instant Investigator",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion can take an intuitive “read” of a crime scene and make a reasonably accurate assessment of what happened there. Spending a Legend point and taking a single general look at a crime scene, the Scion entitles his player to a reflexive (Wits + Investigation) roll. If the roll succeeds, the Scion can tell what crimes were committed at that scene (if more than one), how many perpetrators were involved, how long ago it happened, roughly the sequence of events that occurred, and what means the perpetrators employed to cover up evidence. The difficulty of the roll should reflect how long ago the crime occurred, how contaminated the crime scene has been since then, and how thorough the criminals were in covering their tracks. <br /> This Knack does not reveal specific, plot-sensitive information that isn't readily apparent (like who the perpetrators actually are), but it should provide enough clues in a single glance for the character to develop solid leads that advance the story."
        },
        "MEDITATIVE_FOCUS": {

          "DESCRIPTION": "Whether she is crouching behind a burning car in a war zone, trapped in the yard during a prison riot, stranded on the crowded deck of a storm-lashed ship, or just walking in the mall during the Christmas shopping frenzy, the character never loses her cool. No matter what is happening, she keeps her mind on what she is doing while maintaining enough vigilance to avoid getting caught up in the tumult around her. As such, the character is able to eliminate one point of environmental distraction penalty per dot she has of Epic Wits."

        "OPENING_GAMBIT": {
          "NAME": "Opening Gambit",
          "DESCRIPTION": "Sometimes, victory in conflict is all about being the guy who makes the first move, and the Scion is usually that guy. When he joins battle, his player can make a Join Battle roll like everyone else, or he can simply spend a Legend point for his character to automatically go first in the reaction count. This Knack cannot automatically preempt an otherwise unexpected attack, however, as the character must actually be able to join battle for this Knack to work. If more than one character involved in a combat scene has this Knack, the character with the highest (Wits + Epic Wits) total goes first. If characters with this Knack have equal totals, the default is a separate Join Battle roll to see which of them acts first."

        "RABBIT_REFLEXES": {
          "NAME": "Rabbit Reflexes",
          "DESCRIPTION": "When an unexpected attack targets the character with this Knack, but the character's player fails to get enough successes on the (Wits + Awareness) roll to notice the incoming attack, the Scion instinctively defends herself with double her highest applicable DV. The character cannot preemptively attack her attacker or even shout a warning to her comrades, as she is reacting to an attack that is already occurring, but she is much more likely to dodge or parry that attack. However, the character cannot actually join battle until everyone else does after the unexpected attack is resolved."

          "DESCRIPTION": "Being thrown into a situation full of strangers who have bizarre customs and strange manners (like a fraternity house at the height of hazing) can be disorienting, but the character with this Knack carries herself with remarkable aplomb. Observing the behavior of people around her and reacting supernaturally fast to their reactions to her behavior, she can fake fitting in just about anywhere, with any class of people. She still has to dress appropriately, and the language barrier might present its own problems, but she won't embarrass or draw attention to herself unless she goes out of her way to do so on purpose."

The task cannot seem suicidal or impossible to the animal, but the animal cannot refuse an order that doesn't immediately appear so. “Hey rabbit, go tear out that lion's throat,” would seem impossible to the rabbit so commanded. “Run to that grass across the street,” would be a fine order for the same rabbit, even if cars were driving by. The order can describe a single immediate action (“Bite that guy!”) or one with a single condition (“Come find me when a blue car pulls up here.”).

Whether the victim is being stabbed by a jealous wife, shot by a firing squad, lynched by a mob, thrown off a cliff by a deluded vigilante Scion, or whatever, he suffers no harm from that action.

When a Scion takes an Arete, he assigns one of his Abilities to it. (That Ability must be ranked at three dots or higher first.) From then on, whenever the Scion's player rolls a dice pool that includes the chosen Ability, the pool receives a number of bonus dice based on the number of dots he has of Arete. Alternatively, the Scion can sacrifice two of these bonus dice (provided he has at least two available) in exchange for a potential reroll should his first roll fail. If the roll on which he sacrificed two bonus dice doesn't have the good sense to fail, however, the player doesn't get to roll those bonus dice after the fact. Nor does he get to reroll a successful roll in hopes of scoring even more successes. <br /> A character can have an Arete in any Ability (or as many Abilities) as he wants, but must buy the dots for each Ability's Arete separately.

The same goes for a fellow Scion who has fewer Legend points than she does. If that fellow Scion has more Legend points, the character cannot experience his perceptions. If that fellow Scion has an equal number of Legend points, the Voodoo Scion needs a genetic symbol that belonged to the victim. Also, the victim's player is entitled to a (Perception + Awareness) roll. If that roll is successful, his character has the weird, vague sensation of being watched.

If the victim Scion has an equal number of Legend points, the Voodoo Scion's player must also succeed on a contested roll of her (Intelligence + Control) against the victim's (Willpower + Integrity + Legend). If she succeeds, the Voodoo Scion can then perform a physical action through the victim's body. She can do anything from simply forcing the victim to stand still and stare intently at something the Scion wants to study to making the oblivious victim jump out of the way of a shinobi assassin's flying kick. The dice pool for the action the Scion forces the victim to take is based on the Voodoo Scion's mundane traits.

She exerts all her own mundane traits, except Appearance, through the effectively empty shell, losing all sense of the situation around her own body. If the body she is riding suffers damage as a result of her actions, she feels the pain and suffers wound penalties, but it is only phantom psychosomatic pain. Her own body suffers no damage. Once the spirit horse's body suffers enough damage to render it Incapacitated or kill it (based on the host's own traits, not the Scion's), the Scion loses her connection to it and returns to her own body. If the Scion's actual body suffers damage as a result of something happening around her, the Scion remains unaware of it until her spirit returns home. If someone or some event destroys the Scion's body while her spirit is away, her spirit simply fades from existence. <br /> A victim of possession has only dreamlike, glimpsed memories of what his body did when possessed.

In the old days, the Norse Gods mingled with the giants from whom they took the World, mixing their ichor with the blood of their enemies. Today, that legacy breeds true in the ichor of these Gods' Scions. By shedding a measure of her blood (i.e., suffering a single health level of lethal damage) and spending Legend, a Scion can use that blood to grant a touch of the legendary strength and endurance of the giants. Mortals and animals who receive this endowment from a Scion remain loyal to that Scion thereafter, though they become rude and ill-tempered with everyone else. This loyalty lasts for a limited time and must be renewed periodically by a new infusion of the Scion's blood. If the limited time expires and the Scion does not renew the recipient's loyalty, the recipient becomes feral but retains the physical bonuses. Once that happens, any Scion with appropriate Jotunblut Boons can re-endow the feral being and claim its loyalty for herself. <br /> Endowments granted by these Boons cannot be stacked on the same character, even if a Scion is re-endowing a feral being. They can, however, be superseded by higher-dot Boons under this Purview. That is, a Scion cannot endow the same person twice with the two-dot Boon of this Purview to give the person four free Attribute dots. (That would cost more Legend points anyway.) If he wants the person to have more free Attribute dots, he will have to re-endow that person with a Jotunblut Boon ranked at three dots or higher. If the Scion re-endows a person with a Jotunblut Boon ranked lower or equal to the last one that affected the character after that person's previous loyalty expires, the Scion claims that person's loyalty but has no effect on the recipient's Attributes. <br /> Finally, Scions cannot use these Boons to grant free Attribute dots to (or claim the loyalty of) titanspawn, their fellow Scions, or other supernatural beings.",

              "DESCRIPTION": "The player of the Scion with this Purview rolls his (Intelligence + Prophecy) — without Epic Intelligence benefits — and can do so once per story. If the roll fails, nothing happens and the player can try again. If the roll succeeds, the Storyteller reveals some prophetic hints about events that will unfold in the future. These hints should pertain to significant plot points in the current story or to large overarching questions affecting the cycle as a whole. The more successes the activation roll obtains, the less obscure and more directly useful the prophetic hints should be. The Storyteller can give a number of hints equal to the number of successes on the roll, or can simply reveal a more detailed prophecy as the player gains more successes.",

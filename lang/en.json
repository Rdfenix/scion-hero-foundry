If the Scion tries to exert enough pressure to cause damage or restrain the ghost, her hand passes through it. <br /> The Scion can also look at a dead body and know what killed it, if that cause isn’t already obvious. The answer she gets is somewhat generic (the reading would tell her a person had been poisoned, for instance, but not by what poison), but it’s conclusive despite the presence of falsified or misleading evidence.

This penalty applies to any character with a lesser or equal Legend rating who attempts to attack the Scion.

Alternatively, moving through the water thus could increase her Dodge DV by an amount equal to her Legend as long as she does nothing but dodge incoming attacks. The Boon also allows such random tricks as having the Scion instantly dry off by flinging all water off her body or creating a water bridge so an aquatic creature can swim from one container to another.<br /> This Boon works only on liquid water, and a Scion can affect five cubic yards of water at a time per dot of Legend he has. (If she’s walking on water, she can affect one 30’ x 15’ rectangle on the surface per dot of Legend she has. The affected area supports only her and anything she can carry unaided.)

Nonetheless, the Greek Gods and the society that venerated them held the concept of excellence in such high regard that it became a Purview specific to them. <br /> This Purview doesn’t bestow specific powers, exactly, as much as it magnifies one’s talents to divine proportions. When a Scion takes an Arete, he assigns to it one of his Abilities. (That Ability must be rated at three dots or higher first.) Thereafter, whenever the Scion’s player rolls a dice pool that includes that chosen Ability, the pool receives a number of bonus dice based on the number of dots he has of Arete. Alternatively, the Scion may sacrifice two of those bonus dice (provided he has at least two available) in exchange for a potential reroll in case his first roll fails. If the roll on which he sacrificed two bonus dice doesn’t have the good sense to fail, however, the player doesn’t get to roll those bonus dice after the fact. Nor does he get to reroll a successful roll in hopes of scoring even more successes. <br /> A character may have an Arete in any Ability (or as many Abilities as) he wants, but he must purchase the dots for each Ability’s Arete separately.

Today, that legacy breeds true in the ichor of those Gods’ Scions. By shedding a measure of her blood (i.e., suffering a single health level of lethal damage) and spending Legend, a Scion can use that blood to bestow a hint of the giants’ legendary strength and toughness. Mortals and animals who receive this endowment from a Scion remain loyal to that Scion thereafter, though they become surly and short-tempered with everyone else. This loyalty lasts for a limited time and must be renewed periodically by a fresh infusion of the Scion’s blood. If the limited time lapses and the Scion doesn’t renew the recipient’s loyalty, the recipient turns feral but keeps the physical bonuses. Once that happens, any Scion with appropriate Jotunblut Boons can re-endow the feral being and claim its loyalty for his own. <br /> The endowments granted by these Boons cannot be stacked on the same character, even if a Scion is reendowing a feral being.

A wishing well’s spirit can talk about how many people have wasted their pittances on false hopes. The older and more interesting the object is, the farther back and more clearly its spirit can remember key information. Spirits don’t differentiate easily between non-spirit beings, though, and they consider it rude to talk about the goings-on of other spirits if the spirits in question are doing their jobs properly. Also, most don’t pay too much attention to their surroundings unless something truly unusual happens."

The player of a Scion with this Knack spends a point of Legend, and something in the Scion’s bearing or expression convinces a single listener not to dismiss what he’s saying. Maybe it’s the fact that the Scion is taking his words so seriously, or maybe he just has an honest face. Maybe he came highly recommended by a respected colleague. Whatever the reason, the listener gives the Scion the benefit of the doubt in regards to what the Scion next tries to explain, despite what he might be otherwise inclined to believe."

For example, if a victim draws a gun and the Scion commands him to shoot himself, the victim can shoot himself in the hand or the foot rather than blowing his own brains out. Same thing goes if a Scion uses this Knack at a seedy pool hall to command a smarmy drug dealer to pick a fight with a burly ex-con at the next table. The dealer might reasonably believe that the ex-con could kill him, but he still can’t weasel out of the command.

She can also recognize an imposter when someone tries to mimic the voice or appearance of someone to whom she is Fatebound. <br /> Recognizing others is not quite as easy. If, when a Scion encounters a character to whom she is not Fatebound, she makes a concerted effort to try to remember that character’s looks and mannerisms, the player may spend a point of Willpower to lock that image in the Scion’s mind. After that, she retains the ability to recognize him despite all obfuscation for the rest of the story as if they two were Fatebound. Thereafter, the Scion loses any supernatural ability she had to recognize that character. (She doesn’t forget what the character looks like, mind you. It’s just that the Knack no longer applies to that person.) <br /> The timing of when the Scion recognizes a person is entirely up to the Storyteller as dictated by the needs of the story. If the private investigator who’s been dogging the Scion’s heels tries to slink up to the character in disguise at a crowded charity fund-raiser, the Scion might see the gumshoe coming a mile away (even despite the fake beard, the fat suit, the spray-on tan and the sex change). If a Scion of Loki who’s a rival to a player’s Scion of Anubis arrives in disguise to deliver a cryptic warning, the Scion of Anubis might not recognize her old foe until the trickster disappears with a wink behind the elevator’s closing doors. <br /> Finally, as a side effect of this Knack, a Scion can always recognize when someone who is not in disguise is biologically related to a person she knows well (regardless of whether that person is Fatebound to her).

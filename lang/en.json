    "PESEDJET": {
      "NAME": "PESEDJET",
      "DESCRIPTION": "The Pesedjet, originating from Egypt, is the oldest (though not necessarily the wisest) of the pantheons. This family of Gods claims their origins date back more than 7,000 years, on the banks of the Nile River in northeast Africa, and has endured through cultural, mythical, and physical changes in the very fabric of the World. As a pantheon, the Pesedjet is concerned with ma’at — justice expressed through social order. For the Pesedjet, everyone must know their place, and every position must be filled by the right person. In the times before time, the Titans destroyed the proper relationships between people, and the Pesedjet created a social order in which people could live knowing their place in an established hierarchy. Today, Scions of the Pesedjet tend to be concerned with disruptions in social stability caused by the Titans' actions. Refugee movements, discontent caused by spiritual poverty and unemployment, revolutionary movements — these draw the attention of the Pesedjet as disturbances in the mythical realms. <br />Other divine tribes view the Pesedjet as backward and conservative but admit that the Egyptian Gods truly know how to impose lasting order on a chaotic world.<br />The Pesedjet's greatest weakness is its commitment to stability at any cost. The Egyptian Gods and their Scions prefer minimally disruptive solutions to problems, relying on old patterns to maintain the status quo. <br />Other Gods find this attitude frustrating. Old patterns allowed the Titans to break free in the first place; why perpetuate easily disrupted systems? Still, the Egyptian deities promote tradition and conservative attitudes as bulwarks against chaos, leaving united but reactionary societies in their wake."
    },
    "DODEKATHEON": {
      "NAME": "DODEKATHEON",
      "DESCRIPTION": "Second oldest of the divine tribes,the Dodekatheon comprises theOlympian Gods of Greco-Romanlegend. Their origins are murky,since the ancient Greeks already knewtheir Gods when they migrated tothe Mediterranean Sea around 4,000 years ago, but theywere still changing andgrowing 2,500 years ago,and their forms only becameset around 1,500 years ago.<br />Where the Pesedjet emphasizessocial and cultural stability overand against individual rights,the Dodekatheon has sought toimpose patterns of individuality within thecommunity on humanity. Arete—personal excellence inservice to humanity—is the motivating urge of this tribeof Gods and its Scions. It is important for most people toknow their place, but it is equally important for some to riseabove their stations and create new patterns for human life. In modern times, the Dodekatheon’s Scions seek tomanifest and awaken great spirits in society—as artists,warriors, spiritual seekers, judges, leaders and poets.Extraordinary individuals can strengthen the fabric ofreality so that Titans can gain no purchase on it or ripthrough illusion’s curtains. <br />Sometimes, the Scions ofthe Olympians challenge mortals, and sometimes, theyare the mortals challenged by the Gods. Both routeslead to greatness—an exaltation of human endeavor thatblocks the Titans from destroying the World. The Greek pantheon’s greatest weakness is hubris—belief that the individual is capable of winning outagainst Fate. Every God in the Dodekatheon believes thathis most recent favored Scion is capable of surviving thetitanspawn onslaught and changing the World. Investingtime and training in Scion after Scion, the whole pantheonputs tremendous trust in its heroes, while acknowledgingthat all too many have only fallen into ruin and darkness.The next Scion, of course, will prove a worthy vessel forthe trust and favor of the Gods…"
    },
    "AESIR": {
      "NAME": "AESIR",
      "DESCRIPTION": "Born in the wastes andruin of Northern Europe,among Germanic warriorsand Nordic pirates, theAesir compose the fourtholdest of the divinefamilies. Their pantheonis the product of ashotgun wedding around1,000 years ago, whenthe Aesir and the Vanir(an earlier pantheon) wereboth devastated by theTitans during a war in theNorth. <br />Relying on the safetyof numbers, the Aesir absorbedtheir rivals into their ranks and thuspreserved themselves in difficult times. The Aesir represent a third option apart fromthose espoused by the Dodekatheon and thePesedjet. Aesir Scions promote community stabilityas a hedge against modern life’s harshness. Yet, theyalso emphasize personal rights and individual honor.Therefore, while family and nation are important,injustice against a single person is cause for actionand even vengeance.<br />Of all the divine tribes, the Aesir are the mostdirectly affected by Fate. Nearly every Norse Godand Goddess is fated to end badly at Ragnarök,the prophesied ending of the nine worlds. Bothindividually and as a group, the Aesir motivatetheir Scions to find ways around that ugly doom. They challenge both specific people and wholecommunities, striving for greater justice and firmercommitments to order. <br />On the other hand, theirentanglements with Fate cause many complicationsfor the Aesir and their Scions alike.The Aesir’s great weaknesses are a preponderanceof enemies, an obsession with Fate and a fondnessfor aggressive solutions (which is how they acquiredso many foes in the fi rst place). Titanspawn are tobe killed fi rst; questions can be asked later usingmagic, if necessary. At the same time, the bindingsof Fate urge these Gods to ask for propheciesfrom nearly everyone, as they seek to avoid theirdoom at Ragnarök. Invariably,their enemies grant themforeknowledge of their ruin,with oracles that furtherconstrain their possiblecourses of action."
    },
    "ATZLANTI": {
      "NAME": "ATZLÁNTI",
      "DESCRIPTION": "Coming into being sometimebetween 3,000 and 4,000 years ago, the Aztec Godshave no name for theirpantheon. Other divinetribes usually call them theAtzlánti. Capricious andcruel in a way that theother pantheons are not, theAztec Gods are bloodthirsty, aggressive and violent. Theymost often sire Scions withmortals descended fromthe tribes that spokeNáhuatl, wherever such nativepeoples exist.<br />For the Atzlánti, continuity is more important than communityor individuality. A specific human is unimportant .Likewise, a specific village, family, clan or nation isequally unimportant. The most important issue for thistribe is that the sun continues on its daily course, thatthe moon follows the sun in its appointed rounds andthat the stars continue to shine on their proper schedule.<br />Yet astronomical normality and regularity require bloodysacrifice, and even if the other Gods deplore the AztecGods’ methods, they cannot deny that at least the calendar proceeds in its usual and expected way.Of all the divine tribes, the Aztlánti are the least concerned with the dictates of Fate or the potential doomof the Gods. They are the most mutable of form, the mostmutable of apparent purpose and the least suspiciousof the ambitions of their Scions. <br />Of course, part of thereason for their carefree attitude toward their children istheir attitude toward pain and death. What better bloodto spill to ensure the continuation of the sun’s coursethan the blood of a glorious child of the Gods? The Atzlánti have weaknesses, naturally, and theirgreatest stumbling block is their desperate need forblood. <br />Blood fuels and expedites all Aztec magic anddivine powers, and while Quetzalcoátl might need onlya drop for most of his workings, Huitzilopochtli seemsto need bucketsful. The other Gods wonder how muchof this kind of sacrifice is personal preference, and howmuch is genuine necessity. Nonetheless, the Atzlántineed blood, recently spilled animal or human blood,to do their part in preserving reality. Their Scions aresimilarly affected."
    },
    "AMATSUKAMI": {
      "NAME": "AMATSUKAMI",
      "DESCRIPTION": "The Amatsukami arethe heavenly divinities ofancient Japan. When asked how long they have been around, they are certain toreply “forever.” Other tribes usually estimate their ageas falling between that ofthe Dodekatheon and the Aesir, though it is possiblethat the Amatsukami are not lying about their age.<br />Regardless, the Amatsukami certainly have a different way of working in the World. The Atzlánti work to ensure the continuity of the Overworld in synchronicity with the World. The Dodekatheon, the Aesir and the Pesedjet work to ensure the continuity of human communities. The Amatsukami, however,emphasize the continuity of Nature—the reality of the World and all of its natural wonders, the interactions between theliving and the non-living to create beauty and the mutable beauty formed by states of permanent change.For the Amatsukami,to light a candle is tocast a shadow, and to killa butterfl y is to cause adrought. No action is trulyseparate from any other; allchoices occur within a seamless framework of Now. <br />Therefore,this pantheon works for the right and proper balance of all being: human individuality incooperation with community in cooperation with nature in cooperation with divinity. Its Scions work to establish “ecological” solutions to complex problems, believing that only many-leveled, beautiful answers willkeep the Titans at bay.The downside of such elegant and serene natural resolutions is that they take time to implement, andthere’s a fair amount of dithering about what exactly todo. The Amatsukami tend not to take the most directroute to whatever their solution is, so as to gain moretime to perfect that effort. In situations where time isan issue, the Scions of the Japanese Gods all too oftenrun out of it."
    },
    "LOA": {
      "NAME": "LOA",
      "DESCRIPTION": "The Loa are divinities of ancient West Africa, transplanted through slavery to the Caribbeanand North and South America. They make up the most mixedof the pantheons in terms ofage. Gods only a few hundred years old dwell by Gods whowalked the earth millenniaago. <br />Other Gods might mockthe Loa as mere spirits elevated above their rank and station,but their actual power andauthority certainly matchesthat of their detractors. Muchof the mockery against them,therefore, is social rather thanmetaphysical. Of all the pantheons, the Loa remember their origins as Scions. They tend to treat their progeny withrespect and honor. <br />Indeed, the divinities of Voodoo seem to believe that their pantheon has not yet finished growing, and each God has an array of spirits, minor divinities and borrowed Catholic saints to call uponas messengers, allies and companions for their Scions.<br />The Loa form aninteresting complement to the Amatsukami. Where the Japanese pantheon works for the benefit of the totality of nature in all of its diversity, the Loa concentrate their energyon retaining the energy and holiness of local places. <br />The whole of nature is not nearly so important as the wholeness ofthe here-and-now to the Loa. The Voodoo divinities are ardent believersin the idea that small is beautiful. A house where the inhabitants live in peace, prosperity and happiness is agood and beautiful goal for the Loa. One prosperous village or town ranks as a greater achievement than saving an island or even the World. In this attention todetail, the Loa mock the greater pantheons. Why bother saving the World if the people die and their towns are inruins? What’s the point if your temples are aesthetically pleasing but spiritually dead?Because the pantheon is still growing, the Gods relyon an active community for worshippers who fill themspiritual energy. As a result, the Voodoo deities suffer from a degree of myopia. In the pursuit of unity, prosperityand peace at the local level, they sometimes lose sight ofbigger issues, such as vanquishing the Titans."

      "NAME": "EPIC STRENGTH",
      "POWERS": {
        "CRUSHING_GRIP": {
          "NAME": "Crushing Grip",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion is a fearsome wrestler and grappler not to be trifled with. When he’s locked in a clinch and has taken control of it, the character can not only inflict the normal amount of damage (see p. 202), but that damage is now lethal as well. A character can still choose to hold an opponent without inflicting damage, or he can choose to break the hold. He can even soften his touch and inflict bashing damage instead. The damage the character can inflict when his temper gets riled, though, is tremendous and often quite messy."
        },
        "HOLY_BOUND": {
          "NAME": "Holy Bound",
          "DESCRIPTION": "Only characters whose Boons include the Sky Purview have more freedom to flaunt the laws of physics. Simply having Epic Strength enables a Scion to perform prodigious leaps that leave mortals standing slack-jawed with wonder. For example, if a Scion has Strength 5, Athletics 3 and Epic Strength 3, she can jump 12 yards straight up or 24 yards forward. (See “Movement” on p. 180.) This Knack, however, doubles a Scion’s vertical and horizontal jumping distances. With it, the aforementioned character could leap an amazing 24 yards straight up (from the ground to a seventh-story balcony, for instance) or 48 yards forward in a single bound."
        },
        "HOLY_RAMPAGE": {
          "NAME": "Holy Rampage",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion is especially good at breaking inanimate objects. When he spends a point of Legend and applies his full might to breaking something—whether he’s punching it, kicking it or throwing his shoulder against it—the item’s Hardness is halved against the attack. This bonus applies only when the character attempts to break an inanimate object that is either freestanding or under his control. If someone else has control of the object in question, the Scion must take it from him first."
        },
        "HURL_TO_THE_HORIZON": {
          "NAME": "Hurl to the Horizon",
          "DESCRIPTION": "Baseballs, manhole covers, beer kegs and other thrown objects become tiny specks in the distance when the Scion throws them. Having this Knack doubles the distance she can throw something as a feat of strength. It also doubles the Range of a normal thrown item after calculating the standard increase in Range granted for having Epic Strength. This Knack doesn’t make the character any better able to see or hit a target, however. Nor does it impart extra damage to an attack committed with a thrown weapon."
        },
        "UPLIFTING_MIGHT": {
          "NAME": "Uplifting Might",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion can lift and hold tremendous loads that would stagger even other Scions with Epic Strength. After checking the character’s lift capacity on the “Feats of Strength” table then adjusting that capacity based on the character’s Epic Strength, this Knack (and the expenditure of one point of Legend) doubles that lift capacity. This Knack doesn’t affect a character’s ability to break or throw an object."

    "EPIC_DEXTERITY": {
      "NAME": "EPIC DEXTERITY",
      "POWERS": {
        "CATS_GRACE": {
          "NAME": "Cat’s Grace",
          "DESCRIPTION": "This Knack imbues a Scion with the uncanny ability to remain on his feet despite treacherous terrain or an enemy’s best attempts to knock him down. For instance, a character with this Knack never suffers knockdown (see p. 198) from an attack. The player need not even roll. The character still suffers the damage, but he remains on his feet. Furthermore, a character with this Knack ignores all difficulty penalties based on unstable footing and treacherous terrain. He still suffers speed penalties for moving through ankle- to kneedeep water or mud, but his dice pools for actions taken on such terrain suffer no penalties."
        },
        "LIGHTNING_SPRINTER": {
          "NAME": "Lightning Sprinter",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion is a lightning bolt on two legs, zooming past in a blur, trailing leaves or grit or loose debris from the ground he’s already covered. This Knack doubles the amount of distance he can cover in a Dash action, after calculating the new Dash distance based on his Epic Dexterity. What’s more, it negates the movement penalties a character should accrue for dashing through water or mud that is from between ankle- to shoulderheight in depth as long as A.) the character began his Dash action on terrain with no such penalty, and B.) the character continues to perform consecutive Dash actions. As long as he keeps dashing, his feet skim the surface of the water or muck like a skipping stone. If he should slow down or stop, however, he sinks into the sucking terrain to suffer the normal penalties. Activating this Knack costs one point of Legend."
        },
        "MONKEY_CLIMBER": {
          "NAME": "Monkey Climber",
          "DESCRIPTION": "As long as she has sufficient hand- and footholds, the Scion scuttles up vertical surfaces with cavalier ease. Where a normal climber can cover only half the distance she could cover in a normal Move action on a successful climbing roll (see p. 180), a Scion with this Knack suffers no such restriction. Furthermore, as long as the Scion has at least one hand (or both of her feet) on the surface she’s climbing, she can take a second action at the same time (per the multiple action rules on p. 179) while still moving along the climbing surface. The Scion cannot “Dash” while climbing, but the bonus to her movement granted by her Epic Dexterity still applies."
        },
        "TRICK_SHOOTER": {
          "NAME": "Trick Shooter",
          "DESCRIPTION": "Not only do the Scion’s Epic Dexterity bonus successes add to (Dexterity + Marksmanship) dice rolls, he now doubles the bonus he receives from taking an Aim action (see p. 190) as well. What’s more, the player ignores the difficulty penalty for the character to either disarm an opponent with a ranged special attack or mark his opponent without causing damage. (See “Special Attacks” on p. 199.) A character must take an Aim action in order to be able to ignore such penalties, though. If a character fires from the hip or blazes away in a cordite-reeking, brass-raining, muzzle-strobing gunfight, only the regular bonus successes from his Epic Dexterity apply."
        },
        "UNTUCHABLE_OPPONENT": {
          "NAME": "Untouchable Opponent",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion might as well be a ghost for all her enemies can lay a hand or a weapon on her. The Scion doubles the benefit that her Epic Dexterity dots add to her Dodge DV. She also ignores an amount of DV penalties due to unstable terrain equal to her Epic Dexterity dots. Only the normal Epic Dexterity bonus applies to the character’s Parry DV, though, and this Knack’s bonus to Dodge DV doesn’t apply if the character is merely hiding behind cover or tucked in behind a scutum like a lowly turtle. Only if the character is physically dodging the attacks that are coming her way does this Knack help her out. <br /> Activating this Knack costs one point of Legend. Its effects last for one scene."

      "POWERS": {
        "DAMAGE_CONVERSION": {
          "NAME": "Damage Conversion",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion can spend a single point of Legend to convert all the lethal damage from a single attack into bashing damage, though an overload of bashing damage still upgrades existing bashing damage to lethal (see p. 197). This Knack cannot convert aggravated damage into anything less grave. The character cannot convert old lethal damage into bashing damage. The Knack works only on incoming damage from a single attack."
        },
        "HOLY_FORTITUDE": {
          "NAME": "Holy Fortitude",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The character is the epitome of the holy ascetic. The periods for which she is able to go without food, water and sleep all double. The amount of time she is able to work at a strenuous task without stopping also doubles."
        },
        "INNER_FURNACE": {
          "NAME": "Inner Furnace",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The character rarely lacks for sustenance. As long as he can find some sort of organic substance (from rotting quail eggs to a piece of notebook paper on which someone blew her nose), the Scion can eat it and survive. And as long as he finds a source of water (no matter how stagnant or polluted it might be), he can drink it and survive. Any pestilence or poison lurking in what he consumes burns in the fires of his superior constitution, without even requiring a Fortitude roll. The same goes for drugs or poisons he ingests on purpose, or for any Mickey Finn a ne’er-do-well might try to slip him. He’s still just as susceptible to airborne toxins and any drug injected into his bloodstream, but any drug that has to go through his stomach first stops there. <br /> This Knack does nothing to suppress the gag reflex or make an unappetizing meal taste better."
        },
        "SELF_HEALING": {
          "NAME": "Self–Healing",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion’s player spends a point of Legend to repair a single level of damage. That damage can be bashing or lethal, and the healing takes place in an instant without leaving a scar. (Aggravated damage is beyond the power of this Knack to heal.) Scions who are interested in building their reputation and spreading their legends quickly find this Knack to be one of the more effective tools of doing so, as bruises, lacerations and bullet holes vanish before astonished onlookers’ eyes."
        },
        "SOLIPSISTIC_WELL_BEING": {
          "NAME": "Solipsistic Well–Being",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The philosophy of solipsism holds that only the self exists. Accordingly, if a solipsist isn’t aware of something, that something doesn’t exist. With this Knack, a Scion applies this odd philosophy to damage that surprises her. For a single attack that the Scion doesn’t see, hear or otherwise perceive coming, the Scion can spend a point of Legend and a point of Willpower to completely ignore it as if it never happened (thereby suffering no damage from it). Of course the attack does actually happen—any ammunition used is spent, onlookers might be covered with the Scion’s blood, the would-be assassin might be standing right there holding a dripping knife—but such concerns are immaterial to the Scion victim. <br /> The Scion can use this Knack only once per scene."

        "BENEFIT_OF_THE_DOUBT": {
          "NAME": "Benefit of the Doubt",
          "DESCRIPTION": "Sometimes, for a Scion to be able to help people—or convince them to stay out of harm’s way—those people have to accept ideas that would seem patently ridiculous if they weren’t true. The player of a Scion with this Knack spends a point of Legend, and something in the Scion’s bearing or expression convinces a single listener not to dismiss what he’s saying. Maybe it’s the fact that the Scion is taking his words so seriously, or maybe he just has an honest face. Maybe he came highly recommended by a respected colleague. Whatever the reason, the listener gives the Scion the benefit of the doubt in regards to what the Scion next tries to explain, despite what he might be otherwise inclined to believe."

          "NAME": "Blessing of Importance",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion is especially good at winning people over by making them feel special and wanted. By spending a point of Legend and either sticking up for a person, calling out to him in a crowd or just giving him a secret smile, the Scion refills the person’s spent Willpower points for the scene. The Scion need not necessarily believe that the person is important or special herself. This Knack works very well on mortals, but it’s less effective on Scions, who are usually wise to their charismatic peers’ ways. For Scion recipients, the Knack refills only one point of Willpower per dot of Epic Charisma the Scion with this Knack has. A character can receive this Willpower boost only once per scene from the same Scion."

        "CHARMER": {
          "NAME": "Charmer",
          "DESCRIPTION": "With the sheer, raw charm this Knack represents, the Scion can smother an upwelling of panic, suspicion or utter hatred directed at her for one scene. The player need only spend a point of Legend. One scene is usually long enough to convince a person that it would be in his best interest to help the character, but it’s up to the Scion (and the player’s roleplaying) to actually say the right words. During the scene in which this Knack is in effect, the suppressed emotion doesn’t go away. It merely remains beneath the surface. If the Scion can’t set the person’s mind at ease by scene’s end, the suppressed emotion returns in full force the next time the Scion leaves the affected person’s presence."

          "NAME": "Inspirational Figure",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion’s well-chosen words can play on humankind’s social mentality, giving hope and courage to not just one listener, but a group. The Scion gives a speech to gathered listeners—whether he’s calling upon them for help, raising their spirits after a local disaster or strengthening the bonds of community among them—and spends a single point of Legend. As long as his words are intended to inspire them in some way, every person who can hear him listens spellbound and receives a point of Willpower at the speech’s end. The only limit is that the listeners must be able to hear him clearly without him using the aid of any amplifying or broadcasting equipment. <br /> This Knack inspires other Scions as easily as mortals, but it doesn’t inspire titanspawn. Nonetheless, titanspawn are compelled to at least let him finish his speech before carrying out whatever they’re up to."

        "NEVER_SAY_DIE": {
          "NAME": "Never Say Die",
          "DESCRIPTION": "Not every Scion can knock down foes like bowling pins and scatter titanspawn body parts in her wake. Yet some are just so full of optimistic joie de vivre, even when they take a beating for some spectacular failure, that you just can’t help but love them. A Scion might be accidentprone or have an infuriating talent for picking fights with titanspawn that are out of her league, but she takes her lumps with a smile and inspires her fellows with her can-do attitude. All she has to do is flash a thumbs-up, holler an “I’m okay!” or show a smile full of dangling teeth. When she does, all the Scions in her Band who can see her gain one Willpower point per health level the character has suffered (i.e., however many are marked on her character sheet at that moment). The character can inspire her fellows thus only once per scene, but she can do so even if she’s knocked to Incapacitated or killed—after which, she collapses."

          "NAME": "Blurt It Out",
          "DESCRIPTION": "This Knack represents a gift for making people speak their minds. Scions who have it normally corner a person who has information they want, strike up a conversation, direct that conversation toward the information in question, then pry it loose when it’s top of mind. Others confront victims who are surrounded by family, friends or coworkers, in order to make those victims admit damning information when it will do the most harm. The Scion’s player must spend a point of Legend to activate the Knack, and the information must have legitimately come up in conversation. The Scion cannot simply shout “J’accuse!” then use Blurt It Out to force a random confession from a guilty person. (The declamatory French comes only after the Scion uses Blurt It Out effectively.) <br /> Regardless, a victim still has a slim chance to catch himself before bringing disaster crashing down. The victim’s player rolls (Willpower + Integrity + Legend) against a difficulty equal to (the Scion’s Epic Manipulation + 1). If this roll succeeds, the player may then spend a point of Willpower to avert the slip of the tongue."

        "GODS_HONEST": {
          "NAME": "Gods’ Honest",
          "DESCRIPTION": "When she’s trying to convince someone of something, the Scion puts her hand to her heart, puts her hand on a stack of Bibles, holds up her right hand with her pinkie and thumb crossed in the palm, or performs some other gesture of sincerity. (Her player also spends a point of Legend.) When she does so, her would-be mark accepts that the Scion is telling the truth about the subject at hand, no questions asked, for the rest of the story. Only solid, incontrovertible proof showing that what the Scion said was undeniably false will convince the mark he’s been fooled. Even then, whoever’s showing him the proof will have to convince him that the proof is genuine and not some clever forgery. <br /> A Scion with this Knack doesn’t have to lie when she uses it. She can also use it to convince a recalcitrant skeptic of the actual truth. If the Scion does so, no mortal force can convince that person that the Scion was lying (not even professionally faked “proof” to the contrary)."

        "OVERT_ORDER": {
          "NAME": "Overt Order",
          "DESCRIPTION": "Sometimes, the direct method is more effective than the cleverest of intricate schemes. With this Knack, a Scion barks out a command that the target must obey. Doing so costs one Willpower, and the command must be one the Scion can give and the victim can perform in a single action. “Freeze!” is acceptable, as is, “Don’t shoot!” or, “Shoot him!” Ordering someone to go home and shoot his wife won’t work because doing so would take longer than a single action. <br /> A victim of this Knack can interpret the command loosely to make it not directly suicidal, but not if all he’s trying to do is keep out of trouble. For example, if a victim draws a gun and the Scion commands him to shoot himself, the victim can shoot himself in the hand or the foot rather than blowing his own brains out. Same thing goes if a Scion uses this Knack at a seedy pool hall to command a smarmy drug dealer to pick a fight with a burly ex-con at the next table. The dealer might reasonably believe that the ex-con could kill him, but he still can’t weasel out of the command. He doesn’t have to walk up and take a swing at the guy, but he still has to do something, such as singing out a racial slur or throwing a beer bottle at the guy’s girlfriend. The dealer can cheese it immediately, but he’s still got to pick the fight first."

          "NAME": "Stench of Guilt",
          "DESCRIPTION": "This Knack gives a Scion an insight into the workings of a victim’s mind. If the Scion hears a topic come up while the victim is speaking that reminds the victim of a misdeed he’s keeping secret, the Scion senses the presence of that secret. The victim needn’t feel guilty about the wrongs he’s done, but as long as he’s taken, or is taking, pains to hide them, the Scion catches on. This Knack can’t reveal what secret the victim hides, nor does it point out specifically what was said in the conversation that reminded him of the transgression. Conversational context is usually enough for a crafty Scion to figure out where to start looking, though."

          "DESCRIPTION": "Liars and tricksters know their own. If some matchstick man tries to run a scam, Scions with this Knack know exactly what sort of person they’re dealing with. Whenever the Scion hears a person knowingly tell a lie, the Scion is automatically aware of the deception. This Knack doesn’t reveal what the truth actually is. Nor does it work on text written by someone who knows it’s false or when someone speaks untrue words in a language the Scion does not understand."

          "DESCRIPTION": "Whether he’s Hugh Jackman on the set of The View or the Phantom of the Opera going unmasked at the masquerade ball, the Scion commands the attention of everyone in the room. This Knack is best used when making an important entrance, but it can also serve as a wonderful broad-spectrum distraction. The character walks into a room, the player spends a point of Legend, and all eyes in the room (as well as the eyes of people watching remotely via live security camera broadcast) turn the character’s way. For every Legend point spent, the character can hold everyone’s attention for a number of minutes equal to his Epic Appearance dots. The onlookers can carry on with what they’re doing and keep talking among themselves, but their attention remains fixed on the Scion. <br /> Titanspawn and Scions can resist this Knack. They may spend a point of Willpower to direct their attention elsewhere. Should the Scion with Epic Appearance spend another point of Legend to continue the effect over subsequent sets of minutes, the resisting party must spend matching amounts of Willpower to keep from being distracted."

          "DESCRIPTION": "Some Scions are so beautiful you can’t help but be drawn to them, and a Scion with this Knack makes that compelling attraction inescapable. Whether she beckons across a crowded room, emails a picture of herself along with an invitation or sends a picture message from her phone with the text caption “GYAOH,” the object of her desire makes all due haste to reach her. The Scion’s player spends a Legend point, and she must single out one recipient at a time. The intended target must be able to see an image of the Scion, he must understand that the message is intended for him, and he must have a reasonable idea of how to find her. <br /> Scions whose Epic Appearance represents divine ugliness cannot use this Knack. Also, it doesn’t work on beautiful Scions with more dots of Epic Appearance than the one using the Knack."

        "DREADFUL_MIEN": {
          "NAME": "Dreadful Mien",
          "DESCRIPTION": "Some Scions are so hideous that seeing them spurs the primitive centers of the human brain toward reckless flight. Most humans can clamp down on this instinctive response and remain in such Scions’ presence, but this Knack overrides that social nicety. When the Scion’s player spends a Legend point, the character directs his unholy monstrousness at a single unlucky victim in his presence. Overwhelmed, the victim runs for his life and hides somewhere until the next sunrise. People affected by this Knack run away with self-preservation in mind, though, so they won’t sprint blindly into traffic or try to swim across a shark tank to safety.<br /> Scions whose Epic Appearance represents divine beauty cannot use this Knack. Also, it doesn’t work on hideous Scions with more dots of Epic Appearance than the one using the Knack."

        "LASTING_IMPRESSION": {
          "NAME": "Lasting Impression",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion has an effect on a subject that’s slow to fade away. Thoughts of the Scion creep into the victim’s mind unbidden either to undermine his concentration or to uplift his spirit. A beautiful Scion can use her Epic Appearance to make a character feel good about himself, granting him an extra Willpower point (which may exceed the character’s maximum) and an extra die on any Art, Athletics, Command, Craft or Integrity dice pools. A hideous Scion inflicts quite the opposite effect. The fear she instills robs her victim of a Willpower point that he cannot regain until the effect wears off. The Scion also unsettles him so deeply that he loses one die from all Academics, Awareness, Control, Politics or Presence dice pools. <br /> Using this Knack costs the Scion a single point of Legend, and its effects last for 24 hours. The Scion can use the Knack on only one person at a time, and the target must be able to see her in person."
        },
        "SERPENT_GAZE": {
          "NAME": "Serpent’s Gaze",
          "DESCRIPTION": "When the Scion spends a point of Legend, the person whom she’s trying to affect locks eyes with her and is unable to look away. For combat purposes, the victim is rendered Inactive until the Scion breaks eye contact. The Scion can still act, but she must take a second action in order to do so, maintaining eye contact as a diceless action. (As a result, she suffers a -2 penalty for any other action she takes.) This Knack works equally well whether the Scion’s Epic Appearance involves beauty or its opposite. <br /> Characters of lesser Legend are unable to break the Scion’s gaze on their own, but those with an equal or greater Legend are not so vulnerable. After the Scion using the Knack takes one full action, the equal- or higher-Legend victim may spend a point of Willpower to negate the effect. In so doing, he remains immune to the effect from the same Scion for the rest of the scene."

          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion can be a musician’s best friend or worst nightmare, as she has the innate ability to detect even the subtlest variation in musical pitch. Her sense is so refined that she could catch a single missed note in an otherwise flawless performance of a Rachmaninoff concerto. The lone flub in the middle of the performance rings as clearly in her ears as if someone’s cell phone had gone off during it playing the Spongebob Squarepants theme song. The Scion’s sense of hearing is also refined enough to be able to identify with absolute certainty a phone number or security code just by hearing the distinctive key tones."

        "PREDATORY_FOCUS": {
          "NAME": "Predatory Focus",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion is a hunter par excellence. With a successful (Perception + Survival) roll, he can track his prey by scent alone or by almost-invisible physical signs. With this Knack, the hunter can follow his prey across any sort of terrain as long as the prey continues to flee and does not take significant pains to mask its scent or minimize the disturbance its passing causes. (The former entails such extremes as swimming a mile upstream in a rushing river or taking refuge inside a functioning hog-rendering plant. The latter includes little short of levitating or flying.) Picking up a lost trail with this Knack requires a new (Perception + Survival) roll. If the prey has Epic Wits or a Stealth Arete (see pp. 149-150), the hunter’s roll is contested against the prey’s (Wits + Stealth)."

        "REFINED_PALATE": {
          "NAME": "Refined Palate",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion has exceptionally precise senses of taste and smell (as the latter enhances the former). With a faint sniff or a tentative taste, the Scion can figure out what ingredients compose a certain concoction, and in what proportions. She can also sniff out drugs or poisons that have been added to what she was about to wolf down, as well as detect airborne toxins by the way they make the air taste. This Knack doesn’t tell a Scion what an ingredient is if she isn’t already familiar with it. (She would realize that what’s making her iced tea sweet isn’t sugar, for instance, but she wouldn’t know if it was Equal or Splenda if she’d never had either artificial sweetener before.) Instead, the Knack registers each component separately and provides an indication whether such components would be dangerous to consume. The Scion also remembers the taste and smell of various ingredients she experiences so she can recognize and identify them if she’s exposed to them again."
        },
        "SUBLIMINAL_WARNING": {
          "NAME": "Subliminal Warning",
          "DESCRIPTION": "Whenever the Scion enters an area where an ambush is waiting, even if he has no reason to suspect he’s in danger, certain tiny clues set his subconscious on edge, preparing him for an attack. When the attacker finally springs the surprise assault, the Scion hears the tiniest rustle of fabric, sees the slightest flicker in his peripheral vision or feels the gentlest twitch of displaced air, and the clues he already noticed all add up. As a result, the Scion gains an extra number of dice equal to his Epic Perception on the standard (Wits + Awareness) roll to detect the ambush."
        },
        "UNFAILING_RECOGNITION": {
          "NAME": "Unfailing Recognition",
          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion can automatically recognize any people to whom she is Fatebound. She can pick their faces out of a crowd with just a glance. She can recognize their voices despite electronic distortion or overpowering background noise. She knows their scents and their body language and even the exact feel of the way they shake hands. She can also recognize an imposter when someone tries to mimic the voice or appearance of someone to whom she is Fatebound. <br /> Recognizing others is not quite as easy. If, when a Scion encounters a character to whom she is not Fatebound, she makes a concerted effort to try to remember that character’s looks and mannerisms, the player may spend a point of Willpower to lock that image in the Scion’s mind. After that, she retains the ability to recognize him despite all obfuscation for the rest of the story as if they two were Fatebound. Thereafter, the Scion loses any supernatural ability she had to recognize that character. (She doesn’t forget what the character looks like, mind you. It’s just that the Knack no longer applies to that person.) <br /> The timing of when the Scion recognizes a person is entirely up to the Storyteller as dictated by the needs of the story. If the private investigator who’s been dogging the Scion’s heels tries to slink up to the character in disguise at a crowded charity fund-raiser, the Scion might see the gumshoe coming a mile away (even despite the fake beard, the fat suit, the spray-on tan and the sex change). If a Scion of Loki who’s a rival to a player’s Scion of Anubis arrives in disguise to deliver a cryptic warning, the Scion of Anubis might not recognize her old foe until the trickster disappears with a wink behind the elevator’s closing doors. <br /> Finally, as a side effect of this Knack, a Scion can always recognize when someone who is not in disguise is biologically related to a person she knows well (regardless of whether that person is Fatebound to her). She cannot intuitively grasp what that relationship is, but she knows it’s there—even if the person in question doesn’t."

          "NAME": "Fast Learner",
          "DESCRIPTION": "By buckling down and intently studying certain subjects, the Scion internalizes them in a fraction of the time it would take a lesser intellect.

She might not be a master of any single subject, but she knows a little bit about a wide range of disparate, esoteric subjects. (She could explain the intricacies of the Teapot Dome Scandal in terms of the interpersonal dynamics of the Justice League, then explain why typing “while one fork” into a UNIX system is a bad idea, before wrapping up with an explanation of how a Venus’s-flytrap works.) Normally, the burden of portraying this Knack falls to the player, so it behooves her to keep an ear to the ground for obscure trivia she can work into her character’s dialogue during the game. The Storyteller shares a bit of that burden as well, though. During a scene in which the characters seem to be stumped or hopelessly out of options, the Storyteller should “remind” the player of some pertinent bit of obscure trivia her character knows that bears a direct, helpful relevance to the problem at hand. It behooves the Storyteller, then, to make a list of a handful of such helpful hints when he’s designing his story. Just in case."

She can divide up a 10-party restaurant bill so everyone pays only what they owe or calculate the standard deviation of oil prices over the last 15 years, all while holding an intense conversation about whether Republicans or Democrats are worse tippers. As long as she knows all the figures involved, she can crunch the numbers in her head with only a moment’s pause. She can also use mathematical shorthand and rapid calculation to estimate things like how many jellybeans are in a glass jar at the State Fair or how many titanspawn-possessed Civil War re-enactors are currently rushing toward her across the picnic grounds."

          "DESCRIPTION": "The character remembers everything about his past from before the game started to the current moment in the story. If ever the player forgets a salient point or key bit of information from previous sessions, he has but to ask the Storyteller and the Storyteller will remind him. It’s a good idea for the character’s player to take copious notes on each session’s events and double-check them with the Storyteller, if only to alleviate some of the stress on the Storyteller."

          "DESCRIPTION": "With this Knack, a Scion can help someone else become a fast learner (per the eponymous Knack). When she makes significant efforts to tutor a student in a subject—a distinction best left up to the Storyteller—the experience-point cost for purchasing dots in the Ability the teacher teaches is cut in half, rounded down. <br /> The catch built into this Knack is that a Scion cannot teach a student an Ability that she (the teacher) doesn’t have. Nor can the teacher help a student surpass her in mastery of a subject—which is to say, the Scion cannot teach her student more dots in an Ability than she (the teacher) has."

          "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion can take an intuitive “read” of a crime scene and make a reasonably accurate assessment of what transpired there. By spending a point of Legend and taking a single, sweeping glance around the scene of a crime, the Scion entitles his player to a reflexive (Wits + Investigation) roll. If the roll succeeds, the Scion can tell what crimes were committed at that scene (if it was more than one), how many perpetrators were involved, how long ago it happened, roughly the sequence of events that took place and what means the perpetrators employed to cover up evidence. The difficulty of the roll should reflect how long ago the crime occurred, how contaminated the crime scene has been since then and how thorough the criminals were in covering their tracks. <br /> This Knack doesn’t reveal specific, plot-sensitive information that isn’t readily apparent (such as who the perpetrators actually are), but it should provide enough clues in a single glance for the character to develop solid leads that further the story."

When he joins battle, his player can either make a Join Battle roll like everyone else, or he can simply spend a point of Legend for his character to automatically go first in the reaction count. This Knack cannot automatically preempt an otherwise unexpected attack, though, as the character must actually be able to join battle for this Knack to function. If more than one character involved in a combat scene has this Knack, the character with the highest (Wits + Epic Wits) total goes first. If characters with this Knack have equal totals, default to a separate Join Battle roll to see which of them acts first."

          "DESCRIPTION": "When an unexpected attack targets the character with this Knack but the character’s player fails to get enough successes on the (Wits + Awareness) roll to notice the attack coming, the Scion instinctively defends herself with double her highest applicable DV. The character cannot preemptively attack her attacker or even shout out a warning to her comrades, as she’s reacting to an attack that’s already taking place, but she is much more likely to dodge or parry that attack. Nonetheless, the character cannot actually join battle herself until everyone else does after the unexpected attack is resolved."

By observing the behavior of the people around her and reacting preternaturally quickly to their reactions to her behavior, she can fake like she fits in just about anywhere, with any class of people. She still has to dress the part, and the language barrier might pose its own problems, but she won’t embarrass or draw attention to herself unless she goes out of her way to do so on purpose."

When she confronts someone she suspects committed an injustice and accuses that person of having done so, her player rolls (Perception + Empathy). (This roll isn’t modified by supernatural powers or contested by the suspect’s player.) On a success, the Scion can intuitively tell whether the suspect is guilty as charged. A failure yields an indeterminate reading and means that the Scion can’t try to determine the same subject’s guilt for 24 hours. A botch yields a false reading.",

To use it, she accuses the guilty party of the injustice (be it in person, in a letter, over the phone, via skywriting…), and her player spends a point of Legend and rolls (Manipulation + Integrity). If the roll succeeds, the accusation causes the victim to periodically hallucinate like Macbeth or his wife. These hallucinations occur randomly, torturing the guilty party with the knowledge that justice hasn’t been served. They also render him unable to regain Willpower. <br /> The effect lasts for a number of days equal to the activation roll’s successes, or until the offender makes fair amends, or until the offender confesses his crime to someone who can force him to make fair amends—whichever occurs first.",

Doing so, she renders the next action that would inflict harm on the innocent victim completely impotent, obviating any damage that action should inflict. Whether the victim is being stabbed by a jealous wife, shot by a firing squad, lynched by a mob, hurled off a cliff by a duped Scion vigilante or whatever, he suffers no damage from that action.

When a Scion takes an Arete, he assigns to it one of his Abilities. (That Ability must be rated at three dots or higher first.) Thereafter, whenever the Scion’s player rolls a dice pool that includes that chosen Ability, the pool receives a number of bonus dice based on the number of dots he has of Arete. Alternatively, the Scion may sacrifice two of those bonus dice (provided he has at least two available) in exchange for a potential reroll in case his first roll fails. If the roll on which he sacrificed two bonus dice doesn’t have the good sense to fail, however, the player doesn’t get to roll those bonus dice after the fact. Nor does he get to reroll a successful roll in hopes of scoring even more successes. <br /> A character may have an Arete in any Ability (or as many Abilities as) he wants, but he must purchase the dots for each Ability’s Arete separately.

              "DESCRIPTION": "The Scion can experience another person’s perceptions as if they were her own. These perceptions include input from all five senses, though not the character’s subjective reactions to that input. To use this Boon, the Scion must have a picture of her victim, some genetic token of the victim’s (such as a lock of hair or several drops of blood) or something the victim created (from a printed-out email to an ice sculpture). By meditating on the item and relaxing her own perceptions—as well as spending a point of Legend after a successful (Perception + Empathy) roll on the part of her player—the Scion experiences the victim’s perceptions clearly and distinctly. The victim is unaware of the Scion’s attention, but the Scion remains semiaware of her own surroundings. The Scion’s player is entitled to a (Perception + Awareness) roll to realize if something obvious is happening around her character, such as if a zombie comes shambling toward her with a sizzling stick of dynamite. If something less obvious happens around the Scion, though—for instance, anything that would require a (Perception + Awareness) roll to notice if she were paying full attention—the Scion doesn’t notice while her perceptions are distracted. <br /> A Scion can experience the perceptions of a mortal human being without being noticed as long as she has at least one of the requisite items. The same goes for a fellow Scion who has fewer Legend dots than she does. If that fellow Scion has more dots of Legend, the character cannot experience his perceptions. If that fellow Scion has an equal number of Legend dots, the Voodoo Scion needs a genetic token that belonged to the victim. Also, the victim’s player is entitled to a (Perception + Awareness) roll. If that roll succeeds, his character gets the eerie, vague sensation of being watched. Should that character then spend a point of Willpower, the Voodoo Scion loses her connection and cannot experience remote perceptions for the remainder of the scene.",

If the Voodoo Scion’s victim is a mortal or a Scion with fewer dots of Legend than she has, activating this Boon takes only that Willpower expenditure. If the Scion victim has an equal number of Legend dots, the Voodoo Scion’s player must also succeed in a contested roll of her (Intelligence + Control) against the victim’s (Willpower + Integrity + Legend). Should she succeed, the Voodoo Scion can then perform one physical action through the victim’s body. She can do anything from simply forcing the victim to hold still and look intently at something the Scion wants to study to making the oblivious victim jump out of the way of a shinobi assassin’s leaping kick. The dice pool for the action the Scion forces the victim to take is based on the Voodoo Scion’s mundane traits.

She must be using Rada’s Eyes to share the victim’s perceptions, and she must spend a point of Willpower and a point of Legend to assert full control. (The victim’s chance to resist is the same as for Petro’s Hands.) If the Scion succeeds in her possession attempt, she can “ride” around inside her victim’s body for one scene (or less if she chooses to end the effect early). She exerts all of her own mundane traits, except for Appearance, through the effectively empty husk, losing all sense of the situation around her own body. If the body she’s riding suffers damage as a result of her actions, she feels the pain and suffers the wound penalties, but it’s only a phantom psychosomatic pain. Her own body suffers no damage. Once the spirit horse body suffers enough damage to render it Incapacitated or to kill it (based on the host’s own traits, not the Scion’s), the Scion loses her connection with it and returns to her own body. If the Scion’s real body suffers damage as a result of something going on around it, the Scion remains unaware of it until her spirit returns home. If someone or some event destroys the Scion’s body while her spirit is away, her spirit simply winks out of existence. <br /> A victim of possession has only dreamlike, halfglimpsed memories of what his body did when he was possessed. If the actions the Scion took were especially traumatic to the victim, the victim might block them out altogether.",

Such a foe can be an animal, a person, a Scion or even one of the titanspawn, and the Scion need only look it in the eyes and spend a point of Legend. An animal who sees the Sekem Blaze in the Scion’s eyes immediately ceases any aggression toward the Scion and flees. A mortal or ghost so affected calms down and remains cowed for the rest of the scene. A Scion or titanspawn with fewer dots of Legend than the Scion using the Boon is as affected as a mortal, but a Scion or titanspawn with an equal number of dots may spend a point of Willpower to counteract the effect. Anyone with more dots of Legend remains unaffected. <br /> A Scion can attempt to affect only one victim per action with this Boon.

In ancient days, the Norse Gods intermingled with the giants from whom they took the World, blending their ichor with their enemies’blood. Today, that legacy breeds true in the ichor of those Gods’ Scions. By shedding a measure of her blood (i.e., suffering a single health level of lethal damage) and spending Legend, a Scion can use that blood to bestow a hint of the giants’ legendary strength and toughness. Mortals and animals who receive this endowment from a Scion remain loyal to that Scion thereafter, though they become surly and short-tempered with everyone else. This loyalty lasts for a limited time and must be renewed periodically by a fresh infusion of the Scion’s blood. If the limited time lapses and the Scion doesn’t renew the recipient’s loyalty, the recipient turns feral but keeps the physical bonuses. Once that happens, any Scion with appropriate Jotunblut Boons can re-endow the feral being and claim its loyalty for his own. <br /> The endowments granted by these Boons cannot be stacked on the same character, even if a Scion is reendowing a feral being. They can, however, be replaced by higher-dot Boons under this Purview. That is, a Scion cannot endow the same person twice with this Purview’s two-dot Boon in order to give the person four free Attribute dots. (That would cost more Legend points anyway.) If he wants the person to have more free Attribute dots, he’ll have to re-endow that person with a Jotunblut Boon rated at three dots or higher. If the Scion re-endows a person with a Jotunblut Boon rated less than or equal to the last one that affected the character after that person’s previous loyalty lapses, the Scion claims that person’s loyalty but has no effect on the recipient’s Attributes. <br /> Finally, Scions cannot use these Boons to bestow freeAttribute dots on (or to claim the loyalty of) titanspawn, their fellow Scions or other supernatural beings.",

              "DESCRIPTION": "To use this Purview, the Scion clears her head and looks at the World around her without analysis or expectation. Based on what she sees, the character makes heretofore-denied intuitive leaps of logic as objects in the World around her spark off subconscious connections. The player then rolls her character’s (Intelligence + Mystery), without adding bonus successes from Epic Intelligence. The player may then ask her Storyteller pointed, specific questions about various events that have occurred in game—one question per success on the roll. The Storyteller need not expound upon his answers (they can be quite terse and to the point, in fact), but he must answer them as honestly and directly as he can. <br /> Using this Purview cannot reveal facts about things that will happen in the future, nor can a character use it to gain insight into events that don’t concern either her or the members of her heroic Band. The player can use this effect to gain knowledge only once per story. She can reroll a failed roll until she gets a success, but on a botch she gets no information and she cannot use Mystery again until the next story.",

If the roll fails, nothing happens, and the player may try again. If the roll succeeds, the Storyteller reveals some prophetic hints about events that will play out in the future. These hints should pertain to either significant plot points in the current story or large, overarching issues that affect the cycle as a whole. The more successes the activation roll garners, the less obscure and more directly helpful the prophetic hints should be. The Storyteller can give out a number of hints equal to the number of successes on the roll, or he can simply reveal a more detailed prophecy as the player gains more successes.",
